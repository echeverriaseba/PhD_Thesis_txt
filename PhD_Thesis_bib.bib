  abstract = {Slurries of anoxic paddy soil were either freshly prepared or were partially depleted in endogenous electron donors by prolonged incubation under anaerobic conditions. Endogenous NO3-was reduced within 4 h, followed by reduction of Fe3+ and SO42-, and later by production of CH4. Addition of NO3-slightly inhibited the production of Fe2+ in the depleted but not in the fresh paddy soil. Inhibition was overcome by the addition of H2, acetate, or a mixture of fatty acids (and other compounds), indicating that these compounds served as electron donors for the bacteria reducing NO3-and/or ferric iron. Addition on NO3-also inhibited the reduction of SO42-in the depleted paddy soil. This inhibition was only overcome by H2, but not by acetate or a mixture of compounds, indicating that H2 was the predominant electron donor for the bacteria involved in NO3-and/or SO42-reduction. SO42-reduction was also inhibited by exogenous Fe3+, but only in the depleted paddy soil. This inhibition was overcome by either H2, acetate, or a mixture of compounds, suggesting that they served as electron donors for reduction of Fe3+ and/or SO42+. CH4 production was inhibited by NO3-both in depleted and in fresh paddy soil. Fe3+ and SO42-also inhibited methanogenesis, but the inhibition was stronger in the depleted than in the fresh paddy soil. Inhibition of CH4 production was paralleled by a decrease in the steady state concentration of H2 to a level which provided a free enthalpy of less than {$\Delta$}G=-17 kJ mol-1 CH4 compared to more than {$\Delta$}G=-32 kJ mol-1 CH4 in the control. The results indicate that in the presence of exogenous fe3+ or SO42+, methanogenic bacteria were outcompeted for H2 by bacteria reducing Fe3+ or SO42+. {\copyright} 1995 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract = {Drill seeded rice (Oryza sativa L.) is the dominant rice cultivation practice in the United States. Although drill seeded systems can lead to significant CH4 and N2O emissions due to anaerobic and aerobic soil conditions, the relationship between high-yielding management practices, particularly fertilizer N management, and total global warming potential (GWP) remains unclear. We conducted three field experiments in California and Arkansas to test the hypothesis that by optimizing grain yield through N management, the lowest yield-scaled global warming potential (GWPY = GWP Mg-1 grain) is achieved. Each growing season, urea was applied at rates ranging from 0 to 224 kg N ha-1 before the permanent flood. Emissions of CH4 and N2O were measured daily to weekly during growing seasons and fallow periods. Annual CH4 emissions ranged from 9.3 to 193 kg CH4-C ha-1 yr-1 across sites, and annual N2O emissions averaged 1.3 kg N2O-N ha-1 yr-1. Relative to N2O emissions, CH4 dominated growing season (82\%) and annual (68\%) GWP. The impacts of fertilizer N rates on GHG fluxes were confined to the growing season, with increasing N rate having little effect on CH4 emissions but contributing to greater N2O emissions during nonflooded periods. The fallow period contributed between 7 and 39\% of annual GWP across sites years. This finding illustrates the need to include fallow period measurements in annual emissions estimates. Growing season GWPY ranged from 130 to 686 kg CO2 eq Mg-1 season-1 across sites and years. Fertilizer N rate had no significant effect on GWPY; therefore, achieving the highest productivity is not at the cost of higher GWPY. {\copyright} American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America.},

  abstract = {Sampling strategies commonly used for coarse woody debris (CWD) inventories, including line intersect sampling (LIS), typically require large sample sizes to estimate aggregate volume with reasonable precision. Line intersect distance sampling (LIDS) is a recently developed strategy based on a probability proportional-to-volume design and a linear sampling unit. In principle, the design augments the precision of volume estimators by increasing the intensity with which bulkier particles are sampled, while the transect-based protocol facilitates the search for qualifying particles. This study reports on the relative performances of LIDS and LIS in seven stands in Montana, USA. Particles selected by LIDS were consistently less numerous but larger in cross section than those selected at the same locations by LIS. In timed field trials, LIDS required more time than LIS, but CWD volume estimates from LIDS were generally more precise, more than offsetting the time differential. Conversely, aggregate length and abundance of CWD were generally estimated more efficiently with LIS. Results suggest that LIDS permits more efficient use of survey resources than LIS where CWD inventories focus on parameters relating to volume, biomass, or carbon. However, the constant volume factor design of LIDS is not advantageous where CWD frequency is of central interest.},

The water layer was kept at 1-2 cm in the water-saving (WS) irrigation treatment and at 6 cm in the continuous flooding (CF) irrigation treatment. WS irrigation decreased CH4 emissions by 78 \% and increased N2O emissions by 533 \%, resulting in 78 \% reduction of global warming potential compared to the CF irrigation. WS irrigation did not affect the abundance or phylogenetic distribution of bacterial/archaeal 16S rRNA genes and the abundance of bacterial/archaeal 16S rRNAs. The transcript abundance of CH4 emission-related genes generally followed CH4 emission patterns, but the difference in abundance between mcrA transcripts and amoA/pmoA transcripts best described the differences in CH4 emissions between the two irrigation practices. WS irrigation increased the relative abundance of 16S rRNAs and functional gene transcripts associated with Anaeromyxobacter and Methylocystis spp., suggesting that their activities might be important in emissions of the greenhouse gases. The N2O emission patterns were not reflected in the abundance of N2O emission-related genes and transcripts. We showed that the alternative irrigation practice was effective for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from rice fields and that it did not affect the overall size and structure of the soil prokaryotic community but did affect the activity of some groups. {\copyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

The objective of this study was to understand the on-farm potential response of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorous (TP) to water management practices in rice farming within the Kilombero Valley, Tanzania. Soil samples were collected from three villages in the study area at four depths: 0--20, 20--30, 30--40, and 40--50 cm. Four water management regimes, namely: A = traditional flooding (rainfed) without intensification of rice farming; B = traditional flooding (rainfed) involving a system of rice intensification (SRI); C = alternative wetting and drying (AWD) involving SRI for one cropping season; D = abandoned fields (fallow); and E = AWD involving SRI for two cropping seasons, were investigated as regards their impact on SOC, TN, and TP. There were significant (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.05) effects of water management regimes on SOC, TN, and TP. AWD involving SRI for one cropping season indicated a positive effect on SOC and TN across all depths as compared to other practices. We conclude that water management practice that involves AWD with SRI for one cropping season is a plausible approach to maintaining high SOC and TN, with the potential for increasing crop production while minimizing water consumption.},

Hence, reliable estimations are urgently need in the lack of detailed information in Mediterranean forests at large scales. In this study we provide, for the first time, national-level estimations for Spain based on the information from the Spanish National Forest Inventory (38,945 plots). In addition, we compare and validate two approaches for estimating deadwood stocks where data is lacking; the first of these being a modelling approach based on stand, climatic and physiographical variables, and the other considers the ratio between deadwood and living biomass. We also examine the different patterns stock across forest types in four biogeographical regions according to a broad-spectrum of species groups and forests with different degrees of anthropogenic influence. The degrees are based on levels of protection and naturalness categories. The modelling approach provides more robust deadwood estimates and better predictive capacity than the ratio approach. Alpine (6.09 Mg.ha-1) and Atlantic (3.53 Mg.ha-1) bioregion forests store significantly higher mean deadwood biomass stocks than Macaronesian and Mediterranean forests. However, the share of deadwood in relation to the total biomass stock is greater in Mediterranean biogeographical region. As regards species groups, the mean deadwood stock of mixed forests doubled the stocks found in conifer and broadleaved dominated forests. We also found significant differences in deadwood biomass stocks between forests with different levels of anthropogenic protection. However, forest types with intensive forest management had contrasting figures for deadwood stock. The mean values obtained at national level according to forest type, bioregion and degree of anthropogenic influence, provide baseline information for carbon accounting as well as for other forest policy planning and management strategies.},

Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are considered as one of the main anthropogenic sources for global methane emissions. Utilizing the anaerobic digestion driven biogas, methanotrophs can offer a prominent solution for coupling methane mitigation with value-added resources recovery. Hence, methanotrophs can play a pivotal role in the paradigm shift to consider wastewater streams as proactive energy and value-added material resource instead of waste requiring further treatment. This review is destined to summarize the recent accomplishments in three methanotrophic-based biotechnological applications which are methanol, biopolymers production and biological nitrogen removal processes. Moreover, methanotrophs taxonomy, metabolism, and growth conditions are reviewed. In addition, the possibility to link the aforementioned applications within the operation of existing WWTPs in order to transform ``energy-consuming treatment processes'' into ``energy-saving and energy-positive systems'' is discussed.

Gas flux rates were measured in three distinct wetland zones: continuously inundated areas; edge zones with emergent macrophytes; and edge zones in which emergent macrophytes were removed. Methane fluxes between years were not significantly different in edge zones with and without emergent vegetation, but were twice as high in continuously inundated zones during the steady-flow year compared to the flood pulsed year. There was no apparent relationship between emergent vegetation and methane flux, as mean flux rates were not significantly different in either year in edge zones where emergent vegetation was removed, compared to edge zones containing emergent vegetation. Continuously inundated wetland zones emitted methane from summer through fall, while in edge zones methane fluxes were only substantial in spring and summer. Neither daytime rates of carbon dioxide uptake or nighttime rates of respiration were significantly different between the years for any wetland zone. When CO2 flux rates (daytime uptake plus nighttime respiration) were normalized for solar radiation and day length, solar efficiency was found to be comparable between the steady flow and pulsed years. Methane fluxes were more strongly affected than carbon dioxide fluxes by the differences in hydrology, but only in the deeper areas of the wetlands.},

Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate data. The traditional multivariate analogues, however, are too stringent in their assumptions for most ecological multivariate data sets. Non-parametric methods, based on permutation tests, are preferable. This paper describes a new non-parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance, after McArdle and Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for ANOVA (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description provided by McArdle and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non-parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the flexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non-parametric methods. The test-statistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher's F -ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix. P -values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions.},

  abstract = {Enhancing soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in agricultural fields is an effective option for climate change mitigation and food security. In temperate regions, rice farming under paddy is known to increase SOC stock due mainly to the reduced decomposition caused by prolonged submerged conditions compared to the cropping practices under non-flooded conditions. It remains unclear, however, if and to what extent rice paddy management increases SOC storage in warmer climate regions where decomposition is much faster. We thus examined the factors controlling the SOC stock and the net change in SOC normalized to the duration under paddy ({$\Delta$}SOC) at paddy fields in warm temperate (21 sites) and tropical climatic regions (11 sites) from peerreviewed literature which was concentrated to Asia. Using collected data (e.g., SOC content, bulk density, mean annual temperature (MAT), precipitation, management duration, soil management, crop rotation), we evaluated predictor variables that account for {$\Delta$}SOC variability (i.e., mean decrease accuracy) by random forest regression. The mean paddy duration for all data (n = 170) was 22 years. Average SOC stock and {$\Delta$}SOC at 0--20 cm depth were 38 {\textpm} 1.45SE Mg C ha 1 and 0.34 {\textpm} 0.04SE Mg C ha 1 yr 1, respectively, indicating that continuous paddy management had a positive effect on SOC storage in both climatic regions. SOC stock was twofold higher and {$\Delta$}SOC was four-fold higher in the warm temperate region compared to the tropical region (p {$<$} 0.05). The best predictor variables for {$\Delta$}SOC were MAT followed by soil management and then paddy duration. While organic amendment including both straw and manure increased {$\Delta$}SOC in both warm temperate and tropical paddies, we did not detect a positive effect of chemical fertilizer application alone or crop rotation type (e.g., rice-upland vs rice-rice). Despite high variability, {$\Delta$}SOC in the warm temperate region significantly declined over time from 0.82 {\textpm} 0.10 Mg C ha 1 yr 1 ({$<$} 20 yrs) to 0.22 {\textpm} 0.06 Mg C ha 1 yr 1. While SOC stock was 50\% lower, the tropical paddies showed no clear decline in {$\Delta$}SOC up to 41 years (0.04--0.21 Mg C ha 1 yr 1). These results suggest that SOC accretion might have reached equilibrium after 20 years of paddy practice in the warm temperate region and, if so, {$\Delta$}SOC is likely to diminish to zero in the near future. In tropical paddy fields, on the other hand, slow SOC build-up may continue for a longer term although the {$\Delta$}SOC value itself is not high. While the current study showed the efficacy of paddy management on SOC build-up under the warmer climate regions, further study on the rate and qualitative changes is necessary to evaluate the trade-offs between soil fertility improvement (e.g., soil N build-up) and methane emission.},

Thus far, land, freshwater, and ocean exploitation have been the chief causes of biodiversity loss. Climate change is projected to be a rapidly increasing additional driver for biodiversity loss. Since climate change and biodiversity loss impact human societies everywhere, bold solutions are required that integrate environmental and societal objectives. As yet, most existing international biodiversity targets have overlooked climate change impacts. At the same time, climate change mitigation measures themselves may harm biodiversity directly. The Convention on Biological Diversity's post-2020 framework offers the important opportunity to address the interactions between climate change and biodiversity and revise biodiversity targets accordingly by better aligning these with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. We identify the considerable number of existing and proposed post- 2020 biodiversity targets that risk being severely compromised due to climate change, even if other barriers to their achievement were removed. Our analysis suggests that the next set of biodiversity targets explicitly addresses climate change-related risks since many aspirational goals will not be feasible under even lower-end projections of future warming. Adopting more flexible and dynamic approaches to conservation, rather than static goals, would allow us to respond flexibly to changes in habitats, genetic resources, species composition, and ecosystem functioning and leverage biodiversity's capacity to contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation.},

This study aimed to determine the dynamics of benthic macroinvertebrate fauna in paddy fields in the Meri{\c c}--Ergene River Basin (Turkish Thrace region) by investigating some physicochemical environmental parameters that may affect its distribution. For this purpose, water and sediment samples were collected from paddy fields in the study area during the cultivation season, including spring, summer and autumn of 2016, taking into account the water resources that supply the rice fields (artesian water, the Meri{\c c} River, the Ergene River and Meri{\c c}--Ergene mixed water). A total of 47 taxa (on average 8953 individuals per m2) were identified at the study sites. Water samples were analyzed to determine water temperature, pH, conductivity, salinity, total dissolved solids, calcium, magnesium, total hardness, nitrite nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, phosphate, sulfate, dissolved oxygen and pesticides, and sediment samples were analyzed to determine the content of some heavy metals, including Cd, Ni, Cu, and Mn. The biological risk index (mERM-Q) and the potential ecological risk index (RI) were applied to the data and a hypothetical ecological risk analysis was conducted using our data and data available in the literature to assess the ecological risk profile of the ecosystem based on benthic macroinvertebrates. To this end, environmental factors were grouped based on the literature as heavy metals (S1), nutrients (S2), other physicochemical parameters (S3) and pesticides (S4), while organisms were grouped as Oligochaeta, Chironomidae, Insecta and others based on the dynamics of benthic macroinvertebrates to assess pressure factors. As a result, pesticides (S4) were found to exert the strongest ecological pressure on benthic macroinvertebrate fauna in paddy fields in the Meri{\c c}--Ergene River Basin.},

  abstract = {The secondary xylem (wood) of trees mediates several functions including water transport and storage, mechanical support and storage of photosynthates. The optimal structures for each of these functions will most likely differ. The complex structure and function of xylem could lead to trade-offs between conductive efficiency, resistance to embolism, and mechanical strength needed to count for mechanical loading due to gravity and wind. This has been referred to as the trade-off triangle, with the different optimal solutions to the structure/function problems depending on the environmental constraints as well as taxonomic histories. Thus, the optimisation of each function will lead to drastically different anatomical structures. Trees are able to acclimate the internal structure of their trunk and branches according to the stress they experience. These acclimations lead to specific structures that favor the efficiency or the safety of one function but can be antagonistic with other functions. Currently, there are no means to predict the way a tree will acclimate or optimize its internal structure in support of its various functions under differing environmental conditions. In this review, we will focus on the acclimation of xylem anatomy and its resulting mechanical and hydraulic functions to recurrent mechanical strain that usually result from wind-induced thigmomorphogenesis with a special focus on the construction cost and the possible trade-off between wood functions.},

  abstract = {Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is normally grown under flooded conditions and is a significant source of methane (CH4). Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) is one practice which has shown promise to reduce CH4 emissions and global warming potential (GWP). Under AWD, the soil is allowed to dry periodically during the growing season. In this 2-yr field study, three different severities of drying were compared to a continuously flooded condition to quantify effects on rice yields, greenhouse gas emissions, GWP and yield-scaled GWP (GWP(Y)). The AWD treatments in order of increasing drying severity were: Safe-AWD (AWD(S)) where plots were reflooded when the perched water table fell 15 cm below the soil surface (volumetric water content of 41 to 44\%); and AWD(35) and AWD(25 )where plots were reflooded when the soil volumetric water content reached approximately 35 and 25\%, respectively. Each of these treatments received two drying cycles (all occurring between 45 d after planting and heading). Grain yields and cumulative N2O emissions (close to zero) did not vary significantly among treatments. The AWD(S) reduced CH4 emissions by 41\% and the AWD(35) and AWD(25 )by 56 to 73\% and 60 to 67\%, respectively. Since only CH4 differed between treatments, AWD reduced GWP and GWP(y) by the same relative amount as CH4. Increasing drying severity reduced CH4, GWP and GWP y emissions up to a point (AWD(35)) but continued drying (AWD(25)) did not further reduce CH4 emissions. Given the high early season CH 4 fluxes, drying earlier may result in greater reductions of CH4 in wet seeded rice systems but this requires further study as there may be negative effects such as increased N2O emissions.},

This opinion paper provides a perspective on the contributions and future opportunities of the eddy covariance method. First, the paper discusses the pros and cons of this method relative to other methods used to measure the exchange of trace gases between ecosystems and the atmosphere. Second, it discusses how the use of eddy covariance method has grown and evolved. Today, more than 400 flux measurement sites are operating world-wide and the duration of the time series exceed a decade at dozens of sites. Networks of tower sites now enable scientists to ask scientific questions related to climatic and ecological gradients, disturbance, changes in land use, and management. The paper ends with discussions on where the field of flux measurement is heading. Topics discussed include role of open access data sharing and data mining, in this new era of big data, and opportunities new sensors that measure a variety of trace gases, like volatile organic carbon compounds, methane and nitrous oxide, and aerosols, may yield.},

  abstract = {Soils of coniferous forest ecosystems are important for the global carbon cycle, and the identification of active microbial decomposers is essential for understanding organic matter transformation in these ecosystems. By the independent analysis of DNA and RNA, whole communities of bacteria and fungi and its active members were compared in topsoil of a Picea abies forest during a period of organic matter decomposition. Fungi quantitatively dominate the microbial community in the litter horizon, while the organic horizon shows comparable amount of fungal and bacterial biomasses. Active microbial populations obtained by RNA analysis exhibit similar diversity as DNA-derived populations, but significantly differ in the composition of microbial taxa. Several highly active taxa, especially fungal ones, show low abundance or even absence in the DNA pool. Bacteria and especially fungi are often distinctly associated with a particular soil horizon. Fungal communities are less even than bacterial ones and show higher relative abundances of dominant species. While dominant bacterial species are distributed across the studied ecosystem, distribution of dominant fungi is often spatially restricted as they are only recovered at some locations. The sequences of cbhI gene encoding for cellobiohydrolase (exocellulase), an essential enzyme for cellulose decomposition, were compared in soil metagenome and metatranscriptome and assigned to their producers. Litter horizon exhibits higher diversity and higher proportion of expressed sequences than organic horizon. Cellulose decomposition is mediated by highly diverse fungal populations largely distinct between soil horizons. The results indicate that low-abundance species make an important contribution to decomposition processes in soils. {\copyright} 2012 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.},

Due to the greenhouse effect, an effective doubling of Carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations is expected by 2030. During the history, the concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere has grown mainly as a result of human activity in the Earth. The anthropogenic CO2 emission accounts for around three-fourths of global GHG emissions. The development of GHG emissions is extremely associated with global warming. Approximately one-third of the global atmospheric methane emissions derived from agricultural activities. Throughout the agricultural production process, high amounts of GHG emissions are released, which affect negatively the environment and the climate. The intensity of agriculture-related factors of climate change is varying over countries and continents. The objective of the research is to explore the main agricultural-related determinants of climate change focusing on livestock, burning crop residues, rice production, manure management, synthetic fertilizer use along with the geographical and cultural factors of the pollution.

Often, measures of microbial community structure and soil moisture status fail to inform our understanding of soil processes, particularly those that are governed by complex feedbacks between substrate availability and environmental conditions (e.g. nitrogen transformations). Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, although conceptually regulated by soil moisture, are notoriously difficult to predict based on soil water content and nutrient status. Here, we studied agricultural soils under wetting, drying, and static moisture conditions to assess the impact of current and previous moisture on bacterial 16S rRNA composition; transcription of amoA, hao, norB, and nosZ; and net N2O production. Microbial community composition was dependent on previous moisture. As soils dried, bacterial rRNA contained fewer and more evenly distributed genera. We hypothesize that this was linked to the evenness of resource distribution as controlled by differences in substrate diffusion in wetting vs. drying conditions. N2O flux depended on previous, as well as current, soil moisture status and this legacy effect was greatest at 80\% water filled pore space. Overall, we found that previous moisture affected microbial activity, transcription, composition and ultimately, N2O emissions. Our study demonstrates that, for soil microorganisms and processes, it is not only what soil moisture is, but also what it was that is important.},

Results from many of the experimental studies that we review indicate that some commonly held beliefs about wetland insect ecology require significant reevaluation.

  abstract = {We conducted field experiments to test the general hypothesis that the composition of decomposer communities and their trophic interactions can influence patterns of plant litter decomposition and nitrogen dynamics in ecosystems. Conventional (CT) and no-tillage (NT) agroecosystems were used to test this idea because of their structural simplicity and known differences in their functional properties. Biocides were applied to experimentally exclude bacteria, saprophytic fungi, and microarthropods in field exclosures. Abundances of decomposer organisms (bacteria, fungi, protozoa, nematodes, microarthropods), decomposition rates, and nitrogen fluxes were quantified in surface and buried litterbags (Secale cereale litter) placed in both NT and CT systems. Measurements of in situ soil respiration rates were made concurrently. The abundance and biomass of all microbial and faunal groups were greater on buried than surface litter. The mesofauna contributed more to the total heterotrophic C in buried litter from CT (6-22\%) than in surface litter from NT (0.4-11\%). Buried litter decay rates (1.4-1.7\%/d) were {$\approx$} 2.5 times faster than rates for surface litter (0.5-0.7\%/d). Ratios of fungal to bacterial biomass and fungivore to bacterivore biomass on NT surface litter generally increased over the study period resulting in ratios that were 2.7 and 2.2 times greater, respectively, than those of CT buried litter by the end of the summer. The exclusion experiments showed that fungi had a somewhat greater influence on the decomposition of surface litter from NT while bacteria were more important in the decomposition of buried litter from CT. The fungicide and bactericide reduced decomposition rates of NT surface litter by 36 and 25\% of controls, respectively, while in CT buried litter they were reduced by 21 and 35\% of controls, respectively. Microarthropods were more important in mobilizing surface litter nitrogen by grazing on fungi than in contributing to litter mass loss. Where fungivorous microarthropods were experimentally excluded, there was less than a 5\% reduction in mass loss from litter of both NT and CT, but fungifungivore interactions were important in regulating litter N dynamics in NT surface litter. As fungal densities increased following the exclusion of microarthropods on NT surface litter, there was 25\% greater N retention as compared to the control after 56 d of decay. Saprophytic fungi were responsible for as much as 86\% of the net N immobilized (1.81 g /m2) in surface litter by the end of the study when densities of fungivorous microarthropods were low. Although bacteria were important in regulating buried litter decomposition rates and the population dynamics of bacterivorous fauna, their influence on buried litter N dynamics remains less clear. The larger microbial biomass and greater contribution of a bacterivorous fauna on buried litter is consistent with the greater carbon losses and lower carbon assimilation in CT than NT agroecosystems. In summary, our results suggest that litter placement can strongly influence the composition of decomposer communities and that the resulting trophic relationships are important to determining the rates and timing of plant litter decomposition and N dynamics. Furthermore, cross placement studies suggest that the decomposer communities within each tillage system, while not discrete, are adapted to the native litter placements in each.},

  abstract = {The decomposition rate of stem and branch coarse woody debris (CWD, {\textbackslash}textgreater10 cm in diameter) was assessed in natural forests located in the central North Island of New Zealand. CWD samples had originated from windfalls associated with cyclone Bernie, and had been decaying for approximately 20 years on the forest floor. Species-specific decay rates were estimated from the density of CWD samples relative to the density of live tree samples from the same stands. Decay rates were determined for rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum), matai (Prumnopitys taxifolia), tawa (Beilschmiedia tawa), miro (Prumnopitys ferruginea) and kahikatea (Dacrycarpus dacrydioides) in podocarp forest at Whirinaki, and red (Nothofagus fusca) and silver beech (Nothofagus menziesii) in beech forest at Kaimanawa. The average decay rate for these seven species, expressed as the time taken to lose 50\% mass (t1/2), was 30 years. Larger trees (90 cm diameter at breast height, dbh) decayed more slowly (t1/2 = 38 years) than smaller trees (30 cm dbh; t1/2 = 21 years). After adjustment for dbh, P. taxifolia (t1/2 = 39 years), N. fusca (t1/2 = 38 years), N. menziesii (t1/2 = 31 years) and B. tawa (t1/2 = 26 years) decayed significantly more slowly than D. cupressinum (t1/2 = 18 years). D. cupressinum decayed more slowly than P. ferruginea (t1/2 = 16 years) and D. dacrydioides (t1/2 = 14 years), although these differences were not statistically significant because the CWD sample size was small for the latter two species. An attempt to expand the range of species studied using data from in-ground durability tests was not successful as species decay rankings from these tests were inconsistent with natural forest CWD rankings. Stems heavily colonized by the common decay fungus Ganoderma cf. applanatum decayed more rapidly (t1/2 = 20 years) than those which were occupied only by other decay fungi (t1/2 = 40 years). A tree species and dbh-dependent decay constant, {$\lambda$}, was derived for estimating carbon loss from CWD due to fungal decay and insect activity in indigenous forests. Future research will aim to improve these decay equations by investigating the decomposition processes associated with tree species and basidiomycete populations present at other sites in New Zealand. {\copyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Aims: To assess 1) the effect of the combination of flooding (winter flooding vs. non-winter flooding; WFL vs NWF) and timing of straw incorporation (early vs late straw incorporation; ESI vs LSI) in the post-harvest of paddy agrosystem, on a year-round global balance of greenhouse gases (GHG) exchanges, i.e. methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O); 2) the impact on the net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) and 3) the resulting net global warming potential (GWP). Methods: A field experiment was conducted with fortnightly samplings of main GHG emissions. Effect of the studied factors on GHG emissions was seasonally assessed. The net GWP is estimated from the balance between GHG (CH4 and N2O) and NECB. Results: NWF-LSI reduced net GWP by 206\% compared to conventional post-harvest management (WFL-ESI). NECB was similar in all treatments. Avoiding winter flooding reduced CH4 emissions significantly in the post-harvest and next growing seasons, while delay straw incorporation prevented CH4 and CO2 emissions during post-harvest. None of the treatments increased N2O emission. Environmental implications of post-harvest management options are discussed. Conclusions: Post-harvest management affects net GWP of the paddy rice cultivation by modifying GHG emissions in post-harvest and next growing season without compromise sequestration C budget. The combination of non-winter flooding and late straw incorporation strategies were more effective in reducing both CH4 and CO2 emissions, due to avoiding higher temperatures at the time of the straw incorporation during post-harvest and increasing soil Eh conditions at the following growing season.},

Whilst the performance of the method under non-random spatial log arrangement conditions has been examined in the literature, similar examinations of method performance when the logs have a non-random orientation distribution have not been rigorously attempted. Thus, a corrected analytic approach to the calculation of expected sampling error under conditions of log orientation angle bias is presented, along with a correction to the Line Intersect Method literature. A simulation model is also used to calculate the standard deviation of the sampling error under orientation bias conditions, The two models are then used to examine the Line Intersect Method in the context of a typical New Zealand stand of Pinus raa'iata, comparing and evaluating the performance of the method under four patterns of line arrangements and varying line lengths. Our principal conclusion is that the fan and L arrangement provide considerable protection against the effects of orientation bias, although the presence of an orientation bias can considerably increase the size of the likely measurement error.},

  abstract = {Temperature sensitivity of soil organic matter decomposition is important in determining the role of soils in future climate change. We isolated coarse and fine particulate organic matter (cPOM and fPOM) and mineral associated organic matter (MinOM) to represent labile, relatively less labile and stable pools of soil organic matter (SOM), respectively and incubated each at four different temperatures to determine temperature sensitivity of decomposition. The coarse particulate organic C, which comprised the smallest pool of soil organic C (SOC) was most decomposable and the mineral associated organic C that accounted for more than half of the SOC was least decomposable. At all the temperatures, the C mineralization rate followed the order cPOM fPOM {$>$} whole soil {$>$} MinOM. The disparity in the mineralization rates between cPOM and the other two SOM fractions and the whole soil widened with increase in temperature from 15 to 45 C indicating that the labile pools of SOM were more sensitive to temperature than the stable pool. The Arrhenius, the Llyod and Taylor and the Gaussian models welldescribed the temperature dependence of organic matter decomposition, but the shape of the temperature response curve for different models varied considerably. Gaussian model yielded the highest decomposition Q10 and the Arrhenius model the lowest Q10 for different SOM fractions and whole soil. The decomposition temperature response of isolated SOM fractions mainly differed at temperatures below 25 C beyond which the response tended to converge suggesting that the differential response of labile and stable pools to temperature will be foremost at temperatures below 25 C beyond which the effect will be small and similar for SOM pools of different lability. The decomposition of cPOM fraction is likely to be influenced to the greatest extent and the MinOM at the least as a result of global warming. {\'O} 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Microbial functioning refers to microbial activity because only the active microorganisms drive biogeochemical processes. Despite the importance of active microorganisms, most methods focus on estimating total microbial biomass and fail to evaluate its active fraction. At first, we have described the differences among the active, potentially active, and dormant microbial states in soil and suggested threshold values of parameters for their identification. Secondly, we critically reviewed the ability of a broad range of approaches to estimate and characterize the active and the potentially active microorganisms in soil. Following approaches were evaluated: plate count and microbial cultures; direct microscopy combined with cell staining; ATP, PLFA, DNA and RNA content; microarray analyses; PCR-based approaches; stable isotope probing; soil proteomics, enzymes activity; and various approaches based on respiration and substrate utilization. The "static" approaches, mainly based on the single-stage determination of cell components (ATP, DNA, RNA, and molecular biomarkers), detect well the presence of microorganisms and total biomass, but they fail to evaluate the active part and consequently the functions. In contrast, the dynamic approaches, estimating the changes of these parameters during microbial growth and based on process rates: substrate utilization and product formation, e.g., respiration, help to evaluate active microbial biomass and relate it to specific process rates. Based on a comparison of all approaches for their universality (possibility to analyze active, potentially active and dormant microorganisms), we concluded that 1) direct microscopy with complementary stains, 2) a combination of RNA-based FISH with staining of total microbial biomass, and 3) approaches based on microbial growth were the most advantageous and allowed simultaneous quantitative estimation of active, potentially active, and dormant microorganisms in soil.The active microorganisms compose only about 0.1-2\% of the total microbial biomass and very seldom exceed 5\% in soils without input of easily available substrates. Nonetheless, the fraction of potentially active microorganisms (ready to start utilization of available substrates within few hours) is much higher, contributing between 10 and 40\% (up to 60\%) of the total microbial biomass. Therefore, we emphasize the role of potentially active microorganisms with quick response to fluctuating substrate input in soil microhabitats and hotspots.The transition from the potentially active to the active state occurs in minutes to hours, but the shift from dormant to active state takes anywhere from hours to days. Despite very fast activation, the reverse process - fading to the potentially active and dormant stage - requires a much longer period and is very different for individual criteria: ATP, DNA, RNA, enzyme production, respiration rates. This leads to further difficulties in the estimation of the active part of microbial community by methods based on these parameters. Consequently, the standardization, further elaboration, and broad application of approaches focused on the portion of active microorganisms in soil and their functions are urgently needed. We conclude that because active microorganisms are the solely microbial drivers of main biogeochemical processes, analyses of the active and potentially active fractions are necessary in studies focused on soil functions. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The Swiss National Forest Inventory (NFI) is expected to provide reliable data about the current state of the Swiss forests and recent changes. Since the first Swiss NFI (1982--1986) a deadwood assessment has been part of the inventory. However, the definition of deadwood used was restricted and only parts of the total deadwood volume were assessed. A broader definition was therefore used in the second NFI (1993--1995) and coarse wood debris (CWD) was also assessed using line intersect sampling in the third NFI (2004--2006). This paper discusses the development of the definition of deadwood from the first to the third Swiss NFI, as well as the tally rules and estimators used in assessing deadwood in the ongoing third NFI. Different definitions of deadwood were applied in two Swiss regions and the resulting volume estimates were compared. The definition of deadwood appears to be crucial for the estimate of deadwood volumes, which were significantly underestimated in the first and second Swiss NFI. The minimum diameter and other limits applied must be chosen with special care. Up to 30 m3/ha of deadwood was found in Swiss forests varying with the region. There was little evidence of significant correlations between deadwood volume and such forest parameters as management, site or stand attributes. The proposed target values for the volume of deadwood have been generally reached, whereas the number of snags per hectare has not.},

  abstract = {Finding more sustainable ways to produce food is a major challenge for humanity in the face of biodiversity extinction and climate change. Consequently, research on the ability of agroecosystems to provide multiple functions is growing. In this regard, the relative importance of organic farming and landscape-scale measures for improving multifunctionality has recently been debated. We investigated the effects of farming system (conventional vs. organic) at field scale, total length of hedgerows in the landscape and their interaction on the multifunctionality of 40 winter cereal fields in Brittany (France). Our multifunctionality assessment integrated 21 indicators of five agroecosystem goods: biodiversity conservation, nutrient cycling and soil structure, pest and disease regulation, food production and socio-economic performance. Many indicators of biodiversity conservation, pest and disease regulation, and socio-economic performance were higher in organic than in conventional systems. However, indicators of nutrient cycling and soil structure did not improve and food production was much lower in organic systems. Total hedgerow length in the landscape had less influence than organic farming on indicators, although we observed positive interactions. Granivorous carabid abundance and semi-net margin were highest in organic fields located in well-preserved hedgerow landscapes. Synthesis and applications. Our study suggests that field-scale organic farming is necessary to promote biodiversity conservation and associated ecological functioning in crop fields, whereas landscape-scale preservation of semi-natural habitats alone is likely insufficient. Preservation of hedgerows in the landscape brings additional ecological and socio-economic benefits for organic systems without compromising agricultural production. More broadly, our results call for more ambitious research into the myriad possible combinations of farming practices and agri-environmental measures at both field and landscape scales, to improve both below-ground and above-ground functioning.},

  abstract = {Differences in the dynamics of ecological processes between Mediterranean and colder temperate aquatic systems could imply different patterns in faunal communities in terms of composition and biodiversity (i.e. species richness and rarity). In order to identify some of these patterns the crustacean and aquatic insect composition and biodiversity of four water body types, classified according to their salinity and water permanence, were compared. Moreover, the relationships between species richness and water, pond and landscape variables were analysed. A total number of 91 water bodies located throughout Catalunya (NE Iberian Peninsula) were sampled. Three species assemblages were observed: one for permanent freshwaters, another for temporary freshwaters, and a third one for saline waters (SW), since permanent and temporary saline water bodies had similar composition. Differences in salinity were associated with proportion of crustaceans versus insects and with singularity. Thus, saline ponds had a higher proportion of crustaceans, and lower values of singularity. Conductivity was significantly related to total (crustaceans plus insects) richness, and also related to insect richness. The main difference between the models obtained for crustacean species richness and insect species richness is the significance of landscape variables in the latter, and this fact could be related to the different dispersion types of these two faunal groups: active for insects versus passive for crustaceans.},

  doi = {10.1007/978-3-319-24978-0},
  abstract = {Wetlands are among the world's most valuable and most threatened habitats, and in these crucially important ecosystems, the invertebrate fauna holds a focal position. Most of the biological diversity in wetlands is found within resident invertebrate assemblages, and those invertebrates are the primary trophic link between lower plants and higher vertebrates (e.g. amphibians, fish, and birds). As such, most scientists, managers, consultants, and students who work in the world's wetlands should become better informed about the invertebrate components in their habitats of interest. Our book serves to fill this need by assembling the world's most prominent ecologists working on freshwater wetland invertebrates, and having them provide authoritative perspectives on each the world's most important freshwater wetland types. The initial chapter of the book provides a primer on freshwater wetland invertebrates, including how they are uniquely adapted for life in wetland environments and how they contribute to important ecological functions in wetland ecosystems. The next 15 chapters deal with invertebrates in the major wetlands across the globe (rock pools, alpine ponds, temperate temporary ponds, Mediterranean temporary ponds, turloughs, peatlands, permanent marshes, Great Lakes marshes, Everglades, springs, beaver ponds, temperate floodplains, neotropical floodplains, created wetlands, waterfowl marshes), each chapter written by groups of prominent scientists intimately knowledgeable about the individual wetland types. Each chapter reviews the relevant literature, provides a synthesis of the most important ecological controls on the resident invertebrate fauna, and highlights important conservation concerns. The final chapter synthesizes the 15 habitat-based chapters, providing a macroscopic perspective on natural variation of invertebrate assemblage structure across the world's wetlands and a paradigm for understanding how global variation and environmental factors shape wetland invertebrate communities.},

  abstract = {Rice production in Asia needs to increase to feed a growing population whereas water for irrigation is getting scarcer. Major challenges are to *i) save water; *ii) increase water productivity and *iii) produce more rice with less water. This study analyzes the ways in which water-saving irrigation can help to meet these challenges at the {\textregistered}eld level. The analyses are conducted using experimental data collected mostly in central{\textpm}northern India and the Philippines. Water input can be reduced by reducing ponded water depths to soil saturation or by alternate wetting/drying. Water savings under saturated soil conditions were on average 23\% * 14\%) with yield reductions of only 6\% * 6\%). Yields were reduced by 10{\textpm}40\% when soil water potentials in the root zone were allowed to reach 100 to 300 mbar. In clayey soils, intermittent drying may lead to shrinkage and cracking, thereby risking increased soil water loss, increased water requirements and decreased water productivity. Water productivity in continuous {\textasciimacron}ooded rice was typically 0.2{\textpm}0.4 g grain per kg water in India and 0.3{\textpm}1.1 g grain per kg water in the Philippines. Water-saving irrigation increases water productivity, up to a maximum of about 1.9 g grain per kg water, but decreases yield. It therefore does not produce more rice with less water on the same {\textregistered}eld. Field-level water productivity and yield can only be increased concomitantly by improving total factor productivity or by raising the yield potential. Total rice production can be increased by using water saved in one location to irrigate new land in another. If this is not done, a strategy of saving water at the {\textregistered}eld level potentially threatens total rice production at large. \# 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Additionally, the microbial community was investigated in two non-flooded fields (unplanted, cultivated with upland maize) in order to monitor the reaction of the microbial communities to non-flooded, dry conditions. The abundance of Bacteria and Archaea was monitored by quantitative PCR showing an increase in 16S rDNA during reproductive stage and stable 16S rRNA copies throughout the growth season. Community profiling by T-RFLP indicated a relatively stable composition during rice plant growth whereas pyrosequencing revealed minor changes in relative abundance of a few bacterial groups. Comparison of the two non-flooded fields with flooded rice fields showed that the community composition of the Bacteria was slightly different, while that of the Archaea was almost the same. Only the relative abundance of Methanosarcinaceae and Soil Crenarchaeotic Group increased in non-flooded versus flooded soil. The abundance of bacterial and archaeal 16S rDNA copies was highest in flooded rice fields, followed by non-flooded maize and unplanted fields. However, the abundance of ribosomal RNA (active microbes) was similar indicating maintenance of a high level of ribosomal RNA under the non-flooded conditions, which were unfavorable for anaerobic bacteria and methanogenic archaea. This maintenance possibly serves as preparedness for activity when conditions improve. In summary, the analyses showed that the bacterial and archaeal communities inhabiting Philippine rice field soil were relatively stable over the season but reacted upon change in field management.},

Rice (Oryza sativa) was cultivated under greenhouse conditions in rice field soil from Vercelli, Italy and the microbial community in the rhizosphere of planted soil microcosms was characterized at four plant growth stages using quantitative PCR and 16S rRNA gene pyrotag analysis and compared to that of unplanted bulk soil. The abundances of 16S rRNA genes in the rice rhizosphere were on average twice that of unplanted bulk soil, indicating a stimulation of microbial growth in the rhizosphere. Soil environment type (i.e., rhizosphere versus bulk soil) had a greater effect on the community structure than did time (e.g., plant growth stage). Numerous phyla were affected by the presence of rice plants, but the strongest effects were observed for Gemmatimonadetes, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia. With respect to functional groups of microorganisms, potential iron reducers (e.g., Geobacter, Anaeromyxobacter) and fermenters (e.g., Clostridiaceae, Opitutaceae) were notably enriched in the rhizosphere environment. A Herbaspirillum species was always more abundant in the rhizosphere than bulk soil and was enriched in the rhizosphere during the early stage of plant growth.},

Yet, a generic methodological framework to assess trade-offs in agriculture is absent, largely due to the wide range of research disciplines and objectives for which TOA is used. In this study, we systematically reviewed 119 studies that have implemented TOAs in landscapes and regions dominated by agricultural systems around the world. Our results highlight that TOAs tend to be unbalanced, with a strong emphasis on productivity rather than environmental and socio-cultural services. TOAs have mostly been performed at farm or regional scales, rarely considering multiple spatial scales simultaneously. Mostly, TOAs fail to include stakeholders at study development stage, disregard recommendation uncertainty due to outcome variability and overlook risks associated with the TOA outcomes. Increased attention to these aspects is critical for TOAs to guide agricultural landscapes towards sustainability.},

The litterbag technique is the most widely used method for determining short-term decomposition rates and nutrient mineralization- immobilization dynamics of fine fresh litter (leaves, plant reproductive parts, fine roots, and small-diameter wood). Soil heterotrophic respiration is measured as the production of CO2 and CH4. The alkali absorption method for CO2 production and the gas chromatography method for CO2 and CH4 production are described. A method to measure the photodegradation of dissolved organic matter to CO2 is also described.},

However, count data are often zero-inflated, containing more zeros than would be expected from the typical error distributions. We present a new package, glmmTMB, and compare it to other R packages that fit zero-inflated mixed models. The glmmTMB package fits many types of GLMMs and extensions, including models with continuously distributed responses, but here we focus on count responses. glmmTMB is faster than glmmADMB, MCMCglmm, and brms, and more flexible than INLA and mgcv for zero-inflated modeling. One unique feature of glmmTMB (among packages that fit zero-inflated mixed models) is its ability to estimate the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution parameterized by the mean. Overall, its most appealing features for new users may be the combination of speed, flexibility, and its interface's similarity to lme4.},

  abstract = {Climate warming may lead to changes in the trophic structure and diversity of shallow lakes as a combined effect of increased temperature and salinity and likely increased strength of trophic interactions. We investigated the potential effects of temperature, salinity and fish on the plant-associated macroinvertebrate community by introducing artificial plants in eight comparable shallow brackish lakes located in two climatic regions of contrasting temperature: cold-temperate and Mediterranean. In both regions, lakes covered a salinity gradient from freshwater to oligohaline waters. We undertook day and night-time sampling of macroinvertebrates associated with the artificial plants and fish and free-swimming macroinvertebrate predators within artificial plants and in pelagic areas. Our results showed marked differences in the trophic structure between cold and warm shallow lakes. Plant-associated macroinvertebrates and free-swimming macroinvertebrate predators were more abundant and the communities richer in species in the cold compared to the warm climate, most probably as a result of differences in fish predation pressure. Submerged plants in warm brackish lakes did not seem to counteract the effect of fish predation on macroinvertebrates to the same extent as in temperate freshwater lakes, since small fish were abundant and tended to aggregate within the macrophytes. The richness and abundance of most plant-associated macroinvertebrate taxa decreased with salinity. Despite the lower densities of plant-associated macroinvertebrates in the Mediterranean lakes, periphyton biomass was lower than in cold temperate systems, a fact that was mainly attributed to grazing and disturbance by fish. Our results suggest that, if the current process of warming entails higher chances of shallow lakes becoming warmer and more saline, climatic change may result in a decrease in macroinvertebrate species richness and abundance in shallow lakes},

With cropland and pasture now covering {$>$} 30\% of the Earth's land surface, agricultural activity is also a significant factor in producing the observed increases in the greenhouse gases CO2, CH4, and N2O. Land clearing for agriculture and other purposes is responsible for 10 to 30\% of total net CO2 emissions; the rest is due to fossil fuel combustion. In addition, intentional burning of agricultural wastes, grasslands, and forests makes a significant contribution to global emissions of CO, CH4, NOX, and N2O. Methane emissions from anaerobic respiration in rice (Oryza sativa L.) paddies and domestic animal rumens account for 30 to 50\% of the global total, making agriculture the dominant anthropogenic source of this gas. The amount of N2O emitted as a result of N fertilizer applications is highly uncertain, but may be on the order of 10\% of total N2O emissions. Future agricultural greenhouse gas emissions will be affected by population growth, economic development, and agricultural practices. Greenhouse gas emissions are likely to increase substantially in the future unless steps are taken to control them. Investigating potential approaches to reducing these emissions while expanding production presents a major challenge to the agricultural research community.},

  abstract = {The agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) sector is responsible for approximately 25\% of anthropogenic GHG emissions mainly from deforestation and agricultural emissions from livestock, soil and nutrient management. Mitigation from the sector is thus extremely important in meeting emission reduction targets. The sector offers a variety of cost-competitive mitigation options with most analyses indicating a decline in emissions largely due to decreasing deforestation rates. Sustainability criteria are needed to guide development and implementation of AFOLU mitigation measures with particular focus on multifunctional systems that allow the delivery of multiple services from land. It is striking that almost all of the positive and negative impacts, opportunities and barriers are context specific, precluding generic statements about which AFOLU mitigation measures have the greatest promise at a global scale. This finding underlines the importance of considering each mitigation strategy on a case-by-case basis, systemic effects when implementing mitigation options on the national scale, and suggests that policies need to be flexible enough to allow such assessments. National and international agricultural and forest (climate) policies have the potential to alter the opportunity costs of specific land uses in ways that increase opportunities or barriers for attaining climate change mitigation goals. Policies governing practices in agriculture and in forest conservation and management need to account for both effective mitigation and adaptation and can help to orient practices in agriculture and in forestry towards global sharing of innovative technologies for the efficient use of land resources. Different policy instruments, especially economic incentives and regulatory approaches, are currently being applied however, for its successful implementation it is critical to understand how land-use decisions are made and how new social, political and economic forces in the future will influence this process.},

  abstract = {The key importance of coarse woody debris (CWD) for biodiversity is well acknowledged. However, its role in terrestrial nutrient and carbon cycles is less studied, in particular in central Europe. We analysed the decay process of spruce Picea abies (L.) Karst., the most common tree species in Switzerland. The aims were: (i) to examine the usefulness of ultrasonic wave measurements for characterising of decay processes; (ii) to assess changes in physical and chemical variables of CWD during the decay process in relation to site-specific humus forms. We analysed 25 logs, five per decomposition class within a five-class system, for their density, moisture, C, N and P contents, lignin and cellulose. We also applied ultrasonic measurements to the radial axis of decaying logs using the Sylvatest-Duo{\textregistered} tool. In addition, we described eight soil profiles below the sampled logs and analysed the soil samples for total C, N and P and water pH. All the soils sampled were classified as humiferous Brunisol (eutric Cambisol) with various humus types. The propagation speed of ultrasonic waves was found to be directly proportional to the average tree density and inversely proportional to C content. These preliminary results point out the potential usefulness of this technique for further studies of wood decay. Wood density was found to decrease during wood decay (434-308 mg g-1), whereas moisture increased (94-258\%). Carbon and lignin concentrations remained stable, while N and P contents both increased between classes 3 and 5 (N: 0.41-1.26 mg g-1 and P: 0.01-0.06 mg g-1). These general decay patterns are in accordance with previous studies of other tree species and of P. abies in other geographic regions. However, we did find some site-specific patterns, e.g. N and P were lower and wood density declined less than in other studies. Climatic factors at the study site slow down biological activity and they also seem to explain the morphology of the humus forms and their variations. We found no concordance between the humus morphology and the wood-decay state. We recommend performing long-term experiments in Central European forests to investigate the different factors that may influence CWD decomposition, such as edaphic and climatic conditions, in a controlled way. {\copyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Recent work shows that a better understanding of the composition and diversity of the microbial community across a variety of soils in different climates and under different land use, as well as plant-microbe interactions in the rhizosphere, may provide a key to better understand the variability of N2O fluxes at the soil-atmosphere interface. Moreover, recent insights into the regulation of the reduction of N2O to dinitrogen (N2) have increased our understanding of N2O exchange. This improved process understanding, building on the increased use of isotope tracing techniques and metagenomics, needs to go along with improvements in measurement techniques for N2O (and N2) emission in order to obtain robust field and laboratory datasets for different ecosystem types. Advances in both fields are currently used to improve process descriptions in biogeochemical models, which may eventually be used not only to test our current process understanding from the microsite to the field level, but also used as tools for up-scaling emissions to landscapes and regions and to explore feedbacks of soil N2O emissions to changes in environmental conditions, land management and land use. {\copyright} 2013 The Authors.},

  abstract = {In ecology, multifunctionality metrics measure the simultaneous performance of multiple ecosystem functions. If species diversity describes the variety of species that together build the ecosystem, multifunctionality attempts to describe the variety of functions these species perform. A range of methods have been proposed to quantify multifunctionality, successively attempting to alleviate problems that have been identified with the previous methods. This has led to a proliferation of more-or-less closely related metrics which, however, lack an overarching theoretical framework. Here we borrow from the comprehensive framework of species diversity to derive a new metric of multifunctionality. Analogously to the effective number of species used to quantify species diversity, the metric we propose is influenced both by the number of functions as well as, crucially, the evenness of performance levels across functions. In addition, the effective multifunctionality also considers the average level at which the functions are performed. The result is a measure of the cumulative performance of the system were all functions provided equally. The framework allows for the inclusion of the correlation structure among functions, thus allowing it to account for non-independence between functions. We show that the average metric is a special case of the newly proposed metric when all functions are uncorrelated and performed at equal levels. We hope that by providing a new metric of multifunctionality anchored in the rigorous framework of species diversity based on effective numbers, we will overcome the considerable skepticism that the larger community of ecologists has built against indices of multifunctionality. We thereby hope to help popularize this important concept which, like biological diversity, describes a fundamental property of ecosystems and thus lies at the heart of ecology.},

The straw of a brittle stem rice mutant of IR68 was tested for more rapid decomposition compared with non-brittle IR68 straw. The hypothesis was that the brittle mutant straw would break into smaller pieces during threshing, and that both the smaller piece size and the differences in biochemical straw composition would enable more rapid decomposition. Brittle straw broke into smaller pieces than non-brittle straw during a replicated trial of three threshing methods: hand threshing, pedal threshing, and axial-flow machine threshing. In a litter bag study to determine the effect of straw piece size on decomposition rate of each straw type over 10 weeks, smaller straw pieces decomposed faster than larger pieces as indicated by changes in amount of straw and its C/N ratio over time (P {$<$} 0.05), but there was no significant difference between straw types at the same size. It was concluded that the finer breakage of brittle straw during field operations is likely to be more important than the biochemical differences in overall residue decomposition rate.},

N2O emission increased significantly with the increase in the nitrogen application rate. N2O emission was higher from ammonium sulphate treatments than from the urea treatments at the same application rate. A trade-off effect between CH4 and N2O emission was clearly observed. The N2O flux was very small when the rice paddy plots were flooded, but peaked at the beginning of the disappearance of floodwater. In contrast, the CH4 flux peaked during flooding and was significantly depressed by mid-season aeration (MSA).

We analyzed the composition and diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates and evaluated the roles of environmental factors and dispersal processes in determining beta diversity at both the lake and regional scales. The two Yangtze-connected lakes (i.e., Lakes Poyang and Dongting) were highest in taxonomic diversity. Differences in taxonomic composition were evident among the five lakes, with the two Yangtze-connected lakes dominated by bivalves and/or gastropods, while Lake Taihu showed great changes in taxonomic composition among sites in accordance with its high habitat heterogeneity. Lake Hongze was dominated by polychaetes, crustaceans, and bivalves. The eutrophic--hypertrophic Lake Chaohu was exclusively dominated by chironomids and oligochaetes. At the lake scale, total {$\gamma$}-diversity was mainly attributed to {$\beta$}1-diversity (among sites) ranging from 57.9 to 87.6\%. The total {$\gamma$}-diversity at the regional scale was primarily related to higher {$\beta$}-diversity, with {$\beta$}1 and {$\beta$}2 (among lakes) accounting for 30.4 and 58.8\% of total taxa richness, respectively. Environmental conditions appear to be important in structuring benthic macroinvertebrate communities at both the lake and regional scale. Dispersal does not appear to affect distribution of macroinvertebrates at the lake scale.},

However, it is unclear whether precedent drought events lead to ecological memory formation, i.e., the capacity of past events to influence current ecosystem response trajectories. Here, we utilize a long-term field experiment in a mountain grassland in central Austria with an experimental layout comparing 10 years of recurrent drought events to a single drought event and ambient conditions. We show that recurrent droughts increase the dissimilarity of microbial communities compared to control and single drought events, and enhance soil multifunctionality during drought (calculated via measurements of potential enzymatic activities, soil nutrients, microbial biomass stoichiometry and belowground net primary productivity). Our results indicate that soil microbial community composition changes in concert with its functioning, with consequences for soil processes. The formation of ecological memory in soil under recurrent drought may enhance the resilience of ecosystem functioning against future drought events.},

Secondly, the implications of carbon incentives for existing forests are studied (basing the analysis on an extension of the Hartman model including carbon sequestration and biodiversity values). Then, the expected influence of this policy on decisions about which type of forest to use for afforestation and reforestation is discussed. An optimal control model is used to analyze the choice between two types of forests: (i) one with high timber and carbon sequestration values but lower, or negative, biodiversity values; and (ii) one with lower timber and carbon sequestration benefits, but with high biodiversity values. Finally, the relationship between the Kyoto process and the Convention on Biological Diversity is investigated, to assess whether or not the latter is expected to have any influence on the outcomes obtained in the analysis above. Results show that creating economic incentives for carbon sequestration may have negative impacts on biodiversity, especially for afforestation and reforestation programs. {\copyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Research in this area has often been justified on grounds that (1) loss of biological diversity ranks among the most pronounced changes to the global environment and that (2) reductions in diversity, and corresponding changes in species composition, could alter important services that ecosystems provide to humanity (e.g., food production, pest/disease control, water purification). Here we review over two decades of experiments that have examined how species richness of primary producers influences the suite of ecological processes that are controlled by plants and algae in terrestrial, marine, and freshwater ecosystems. Using formal meta-analyses, we assess the balance of evidence for eight fundamental questions and corresponding hypotheses about the functional role of producer diversity in ecosystems. These include questions about how primary producer diversity influences the efficiency of resource use and biomass production in ecosystems, how primary producer diversity influences the transfer and recycling of biomass to other trophic groups in a food web, and the number of species and spatial /temporal scales at which diversity effects are most apparent. After summarizing the balance of evidence and stating our own confidence in the conclusions, we outline several new questions that must now be addressed if this field is going to evolve into a predictive science that can help conserve and manage ecological processes in ecosystems. {\copyright} 2011 Botanical Society of America.},

Moreover, most of these studies have been conducted in Poaceae and Cyperaceae species, being scarce the literature on Chenopodiaceae species, which are abundant in Mediterranean salt marshes. Here we analyse the litter decomposition process of two Chenopodiaceae (Sarcocornia fruticosa and Halimione portulacoides) and one Poaceae (Elytrigia atherica) species, belonging S. fruticosa to a halophilous scrub habitat and the other two to a salt meadow habitat of a Mediterranean salt marsh. For each species, we analysed litter decomposition rates, litter quality, fungal and bacterial biomass and potential extracellular enzymes activities. In order to embrace the spatial heterogeneity, two zones were considered within each habitat. Litter of E. atherica decomposed 7- and 13-fold slower than those of S. fruticosa and H. portulacoides, respectively, suggesting that this species is the one that would favour most the carbon sequestration into the soil. The different decomposition rates would be explained by the higher initial lignin and cellulose content of E. atherica rather than by the initial carbon and nitrogen content and C/N ratio. Moreover, enzyme efficiency, compared to enzyme activity, better contributes to explain the different decomposition rates observed. Bacteria dominated throughout the litter decomposition process regardless the species, but fungi increased their relevance in the later stages, when the relative lignin litter content increased. Litter decomposition was affected by microhabitat spatial differences, although the responses depended on the species. Hence, flooding (in the habitat of S. fruticosa) or soil texture (in the habitat of E. atherica and H. portulacoides) might have modulated the decomposition process, being H. portulacoides the most sensitive species to the spatial differences of the salt meadow habitat.},

However, studies have mainly focused on tidal salt marshes, while knowledge about non-tidal salt marshes, which prevail in the Mediterranean Basin, is currently scarce. Consequently, we aimed to (1) estimate the carbon stocks of the vegetation, litter, and soil of three natural Habitats of Community Interest of a Mediterranean non-tidal salt marsh--a halophilous scrub, a salt meadow, and a glasswort sward--and (2) determine how differences in floristic composition and community structure among habitats over 1 year are related to the amount and distribution of carbon stored in plants and soils. Results show that the halophilous scrub and the salt meadow were constituted by mature plant communities with overall stable carbon stocks in the vegetation, litter, and soil (0--20 cm), which were approximately 4 and 2.5 times larger, respectively, than those found in the glasswort sward (1013 {\textpm} 40 g C m-2). However, while the salt meadow and the glasswort sward had more carbon stored in the soil than in the vegetation (approximately 3 and 7.5 times more, respectively), the halophilous scrub had similar amounts in both compartments (2248 {\textpm} 388 and 1566 {\textpm} 179 g C m-2 in the soil and vegetation, respectively). Sarcocornia fruticosa represented 93.5\% of the total plant biomass of the halophilous scrub, which highlights the importance of this species in maintaining carbon stocks in this Mediterranean non-tidal salt marsh.},

However, their impact on the rhizosphere microbiota and N2O emissions is scarcely known. Therefore, the present research studies the ecological changes in the bulk-substrate microbiome and its correlation with N2O emissions in a perlite-based system tomato crop under (i) conventional synthetic fertigation management; (ii) fertigation with struvite; and (iii) struvite and AN. A high bacterial diversity and the natural presence of plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria in a soilless system are highlighted. However, the different N-NH4+:N-NO3- ratios influence the ecological niches of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB), with a stronger response by AOB community, while AOA kept constant regarding the fertilization applied. Despite this, enrichment of N-transforming bacterial phylotypes was relatively enhanced (mainly Nitrosomonas, Nitrosospira, and Nitrospira) concomitant with the production of N2O emissions when ammonium fertilization was overapplied. In the absence of a plant, N2O emissions were positively correlated, respectively, with Nitrosospira and AOB:AOA ratio, suggesting potential indicators for ammonium availability in the substrate. Fertilizer blends using recovered nutrients are a feasible alternative for increasing circularity in horticulture. Nevertheless, optimum fertilizer management is needed due to its influence on rhizosphere microbiota and N2O emissions.},

  abstract = {Rice systems provide a major source of calories for more than half of the world's population; however, they also use more water than other major crops. Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) is an irrigation practice (introduction of unsaturated soil conditions during the growing season) that can reduce water inputs in rice, yet it has not been widely adopted, in part, due to the potential for reduced yields. We conducted a meta-analysis to: 1) quantify the effect of AWD on rice yields and water use; and 2) to identify soil properties and management practices that favor AWD yields and promote low water use relative to continuous flooding (CF- control). We analyzed 56 studies with 528 side-by-side comparisons of AWD with CF. Overall, AWD decreased yields by 5.4\%; however under Mild AWD (i.e. when soil water potential was {$\geq$} -20 kPa or field water level did not drop below 15 cm from the soil surface), yields were not significantly reduced in most circumstances. In contrast, Severe AWD (when soils dried beyond -20 kPa) resulted in yield losses of 22.6\% relative to CF. These yield losses were most pronounced in soils with pH {$\geq$} 7 or carbon {$<$} 1\% or when AWD was imposed throughout the season. While water use was lowest under Severe AWD, under Mild AWD water use was reduced by 23.4\% relative to CF. Our findings both highlight the potential of AWD to reduce water inputs without jeopardizing yield as well as the conditions under which these results can be realized.},

  abstract = {Continuously flooded rice systems are a major contributor to global rice production and food security. Allowing the soil to dry periodically during the growing season (such as with alternate wetting and drying irrigation - AWD) has been shown to decrease methane emissions, water usage, and heavy metal accumulation in rice grain. However, the effects of AWD on rice yields are variable and not well understood. A two-year study was established to quantify the impacts of a range of treatments differing in AWD severity (degree of soil drying between flooding events) on yield (as well as factors that may affect yields), soil hydrology in the soil profile, and grain arsenic (As) concentrations relative to a continuously flooded control (CF). Three AWD treatments of increasing severity were imposed between full canopy cover (around 45 days after sowing) and 50\% heading: AWD-Safe (field was reflooded when the perched water table reached 15 cm below the soil surface) and AWD35 and AWD25 (field was reflooded when the soil volumetric water content at 0--15 cm depth reached 35\% and 25\%, respectively). During the drying periods, the 0--15 cm soil layer in the AWD-Safe remained saturated, whereas in AWD35 and AWD25 the soil dried to the desired volumetric water contents. In contrast, soil moisture at 25--35 cm below the soil surface was similar across all treatments. Yield was not reduced in any of the AWD treatments, compared to the CF control. There were no consistent differences in yield components, 13C discrimination, and N dynamics. Results suggest that the availability of water and the presence of roots at the 25--35 cm soil depth during the drying periods ensured that the crop did not suffer drought stress and thus yields were maintained. Grain As concentration in the AWD-Safe treatment was similar to that in the CF control but decreased by 56--68\% in AWD35 and AWD25. AWD-Safe is often promoted as a means of practicing AWD without reducing yields; however, in this study this practice did not reduce grain As concentration because the soil did not reach an unsaturated state. These findings demonstrate that knowledge of surface and subsurface hydrology, and the root system are important for understanding the potential of AWD.},

The first model selection criterion to gain widespread acceptance, AIC was introduced in 1973 by Hirotugu Akaike as an extension to the maximum likelihood principle. Maximum likelihood is conventionally applied to estimate the parameters of a model once the structure and dimension of the model have been formulated. Akaike's seminal idea was to combine into a single procedure the process of estimation with structural and dimensional determination. This article reviews the conceptual and theoretical foundations for AIC, discusses its properties and its predictive interpretation, and provides a synopsis of important practical issues pertinent to its application. Comparisons and delineations are drawn between AIC and its primary competitor, the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). In addition, the article covers refinements of AIC for settings where the asymptotic conditions and model specification assumptions that underlie the justification of AIC may be violated.

Documents (n = 113) related to CSA and published in peer-reviewed journals, books, working papers, and scientific reports from 2004 to 2016 were reviewed. Three key trends emerged from the analysis: studies are biased towards global policy agendas; research focuses on scientific and technical issues; and the integration of mitigation, adaptation, and food security (the three pillars of CSA) is becoming a popular scholarly solution. Findings suggest that CSA is a fairly new concept used to describe a range of adaptation and mitigation practices without a specific set of criteria. Although CSA is often framed around the three pillars, the underlying issues constructing the discourse differ at global, developing, and developed country scales. Although there is increasing research on developing countries, particularly in relation to how CSA can transform smallholder agriculture, there is a paucity of research documenting the experiences from developed countries. The findings suggest that research on CSA needs to move beyond solely focussing on scientific approaches and only in certain geographical contexts. If CSA is to be applicable for farmers across the globe, then cross-disciplinary research that is underpinned by broad socio-economic and political contexts is essential to understand how differences in narratives might affect implementation on-theground in both developing and developed countries.},

Traditional rarefaction or extrapolation to equal-sized samples can misrepresent the relationships between the richnesses of the communities being compared because a sample of a given size may be sufficient to fully characterize the lower diversity community, but insufficient to characterize the richer community. Thus, the traditional method systematically biases the degree of differences between community richnesses. We derived a new analytic method for seamless coverage-based rarefaction and extrapolation. We show that this method yields less biased comparisons of richness between communities, and manages this with less total sampling effort. When this approach is integrated with an adaptive coverage-based stopping rule during sampling, samples may be compared directly without rarefaction, so no extra data is taken and none is thrown away. Even if this stopping rule is not used during data collection, coveragebased rarefaction throws away less data than traditional size-based rarefaction, and more efficiently finds the correct ranking of communities according to their true richnesses. Several hypothetical and real examples demonstrate these advantages. {\copyright} 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

  abstract = {Quantifying and assessing changes in biological diversity are central aspects of many ecological studies, yet accurate methods of estimating biological diversity from sampling data have been elusive. Hill numbers, or the effective number of species, are increasingly used to characterize the taxonomic, phylogenetic, or functional diversity of an assemblage. However, empirical estimates of Hill numbers, including species richness, tend to be an increasing function of sampling effort and, thus, tend to increase with sample completeness. Integrated curves based on sampling theory that smoothly link rarefaction (interpolation) and prediction (extrapolation) standardize samples on the basis of sample size or sample completeness and facilitate the comparison of biodiversity data. Here we extended previous rarefaction and extrapolation models for species richness (Hill number qD, where q = 0) to measures of taxon diversity incorporating relative abundance (i.e., for any Hill number qD, q {\textbackslash}textgreater 0) and present a unified approach for both individual-based (abundance) data and samplebased (incidence) data. Using this unified sampling framework, we derive both theoretical formulas and analytic estimators for seamless rarefaction and extrapolation based on Hill numbers. Detailed examples are provided for the first three Hill numbers: q = 0 (species richness), q = 1 (the exponential of Shannon's entropy index), and q = 2 (the inverse of Simpson's concentration index). We developed a bootstrap method for constructing confidence intervals around Hill numbers, facilitating the comparison of multiple assemblages of both rarefied and extrapolated samples. The proposed estimators are accurate for both rarefaction and short-range extrapolation. For long-range extrapolation, the performance of the estimators depends on both the value of q and on the extrapolation range. We tested our methods on simulated data generated from species abundance models and on data from large species inventories. We also illustrate the formulas and estimators using empirical data sets from biodiversity surveys of temperate forest spiders and tropical ants. {\copyright} 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.},

  abstract = {The demand for agricultural goods is currently higher than it has ever been before due to the expansion of the world population. This has resulted in the conversion of grassland into agricultural areas, the development of high-energy-intensive agriculture production systems, and the use of additional chemical and organic inputs in agricultural production systems. The output of greenhouse gases (GHGs) has also increased in the same way. Carbon dioxide (CO2), Nitrous Oxide (N2O), and Methane (CH4) is the most significant greenhouse gases (GHGS) that are producing a variety of disastrous consequences due to climate change. Despite the fact that CH4 and N2O are released in smaller amounts than CO2, they have a larger Global Warming Potential than CO2. This analysis begins with an examination of the variables that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, which covers both inorganic factors (such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers) and organic factors (Animal manure, composted manure, bio-solids, crop species). This study underlines the need for more research into the intricate interactions of physical, chemical, and biological elements in the near future. Field crops other than cereals, such as legumes, oilseeds, vegetables, and fruits, account for a significant amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Precision agriculture may be a viable option for increasing agricultural efficiency. Optimal management practices should be implemented in farm and field settings through methodical, site-specific approaches.},

The incorporation of carbon (C) from rice residue into DOM and MB in paddy soils under aerobic condition when rice straw remains in the field is poorly understood. A one-year incubation experiment was conducted, in which 13C-labelled rice straw was added to a cultivation chronosequence of paddy soils ranging from 0 to 100 years. Rice straw was rapidly decomposed during the first 30 days, after which 73\% of the added straw C, on average, was retained in the soil and 46\% of the straw C remained in the soil after one year. Throughout the entire incubation period, 0.2--0.9\% of the added straw C was incorporated into DOM, and 2--5\% was recovered in MB. The paddy cultivation age strongly affected the straw contribution to the organic C pools. In barren land (0 year), 32--60\% of the DOM was derived from straw C, while 13--30\% of the DOM was derived from straw C in 5--100-year paddy soils. On average, straw C contributed to 88\% of the MB in barren land, 50\% in 5-year soil, and 13\% in 100-year soil. Consequently, over the duration of paddy cultivation, the contribution of rice straw C to the MB decreased, while the contribution of SOM increased. Our study has indicated that DOM in paddy soils mainly originates from SOM rather than from added plant residues but that plant residues are an important C source for microorganisms.},

Understanding how the microbial CUE and microbial necromass respond to fertilization is crucial for the evaluation of the C sequestration potential in intensively managed paddy soils. We examined the microbial CUE, microbial biomass turnover, and necromass accumulation in rice rhizosphere and bulk soils subjected to long-term (31 years) fertilizations: no fertilizers (control), mineral fertilizers alone (NPK), mineral fertilizers plus rice straw incorporation (NPK-Straw), and mineral fertilizers combined with a low or a high amount of organic manure (NPK-lowM or NPK-highM). The microbial CUE was determined by 18O incorporation into DNA. Microbial necromass accumulation was quantified by the biomarker analysis of amino sugars. Rice straw and manure incorporation reduced the microbial CUE in the rhizosphere soil, whereas the CUE remained constant in the bulk soil. CUE was lower in the rhizosphere soil than in the bulk soil due to nutrients uptake and root exudate release by rice plants, leading to a higher C/nutrient ratio in the rhizosphere. Organic inputs strengthened these rhizosphere processes and could thus weaken the relative potential of C sequestration. The microbial CUE decreased with the increase of the available C/N ratio in the rhizosphere but not in the bulk soil. The microbial CUE mainly depended on the respiration in the bulk soil and on the microbial growth in the rhizosphere soil, indicating the divergent microbial utilization of organic substrates between rhizosphere and bulk soils. In both rhizosphere and bulk soils, organic inputs promoted the microbial biomass growth rate and further increased the amount of microbial necromass by 27--52 \% compared with NPK alone, which was highly correlated with the soil organic C pools. Despite enhancing rhizosphere respiration, our findings highlight that rice straw and manure applications increase C sequestration in paddy soils by enhancing the net flux of microbial biomass formation, and consequently promoting necromass accumulation.},

However, little is known about the responses of n-DAMO in intertidal wetlands to periodic drying-wetting caused by tidal cycling. Here, comparative experiments (waterlogged, desiccated, reflooded) with the Yangtze estuarine intertidal sediments were performed to examine the effects of periodic tidal changes on n-DAMO microbial communities, abundances, and potential activities. Functional gene sequencing indicated the coexistence of n-DAMO bacteria and archaea in the tide-fluctuating environments and generally higher biodiversity under reflooded conditions than consecutive inundation or emersion. The n-DAMO microbial abundance and associated activity varied significantly during alternative exposure and inundation, with higher abundance and activity under the waterlogged than desiccated conditions. Reflooding of intertidal wetlands might intensify n-DAMO activities, indicating the resilience of n-DAMO microbial metabolisms to the wetting-drying events. Structural equation modeling and correlation analysis showed that n-DAMO activity was highly related to n-DAMO microbial abundance and substrate availability under inundation, whereas salt accumulation in sediment was the primary factor restraining n-DAMO activity under the desiccation. Overall, this study reveals tidal-induced shifts of n-DAMO activity and associated contribution to mitigating CH4, which may help accurately project CH4 emission from intertidal wetlands under different tidal scenarios.},

  abstract = {Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation is a reliable and widespread water-saving technology for rice production. This review aimed to comprehensively assess the changes in water use, yield, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions after AWD adoption and explore the optimal AWD water thresholds. Based on abundant data obtained from contrasting experiments between AWD and continuous flooding (CF) irrigation, the effects of AWD were quantified by stepwise multiple linear regression (MLR). The quantitative indices are the changes in total irrigation water ({$\Delta$}IW), water productivity ({$\Delta$}WP), grain yields ({$\Delta$}GY), NUE indices, global warming potential ({$\Delta$}GWP), and yield-scaled global warming potential ({$\Delta$}YGWP) between AWD and CF. It was found that the {$\Delta$}C-A (i.e. the difference between the CF and AWD thresholds) and soil types were the most noteworthy indicators affecting IW, water productivity, yield and partial factor productivity of N (PFPN). Meanwhile, the {$\Delta$}C-A and fertilizer-N rates (NR) were two key indicators affecting GHG emissions. Thereafter, for different soil types, a group of optimization models were established to explore the optimal AWD water thresholds for optimizing {$\Delta$}IW and {$\Delta$}WP simultaneously without yield, NUE, and GHG emissions penalties. The results showed that the optimal upper limit of AWD (UAWD) should be equal to the upper limit of the CF (UCF), and the optimal lower limit of AWD (LAWD) can be obtained by the model. Taking the clay paddy field as an example, the min {$\Delta$}IW were -41\% to -8\%, and the max {$\Delta$}WP were 11\%--54\% after adopting optimal AWD water managements. The corresponding {$\Delta$}GY, {$\Delta$}PFPN, {$\Delta$}GWP, {$\Delta$}YGWP were 0\%--1\%, 0\%--1\%, -66\% to -15\% and -52\% to -12\%, respectively. This review provides a novel way to estimate the performance of AWD and provide guidance for proper AWD water management.},

  abstract = {Sustainable forest management relies on the understanding of biodiversity response to disturbance and the ecological resilience of the system. The dynamic equilibrium hypothesis (DEM) predicts that site productivity will modulate the effects of disturbance gradient on biodiversity. Also, considering functional diversity (eco-morfo-phisicological traits related to resource usage) is needed to understand the effect of species gains and losses on ecosystem functionality. Here we assess the response of understory plant taxonomic and functional diversity to increasing harvesting intensities (0, 30, 50 and 70\% of basal area removed) at three woodland sites of contrasting biomass growth (productivity) in northern Patagonia. Also, we assessed resilience based on comparisons with undisturbed treatments four years after initial harvest. In agreement with DEM, both taxonomic and functional diversity peaked at high, medium, or low harvesting intensities in the high-, medium-, or low-productivity site, respectively. Taxonomic composition was clearly determined by site productivity (biomass growth), while no pattern emerged for functional composition. Functional traits related to light use showed different responses: specific leaf area was only affected by site productivity while leaf chlorophyll content was affected by an interaction between harvesting intensity and site productivity. Interestingly, there was no effect of harvesting intensity on the resilience of taxonomic diversity and functional composition. Only for functional diversity, harvesting intensity was as important as site productivity. In the high and intermediate productivity sites the traits that characterizes the system were more resilient and resembled the control treatment after four years of low or high (but not intermediate) harvesting intensities. Our results support the use of the DEM on forest interventions and the importance of considering both taxonomic and functional composition, as the consideration of functional traits related to resource use strategies have different implications when considering the resilience of the system.},

  abstract = {Carbon sequestration by afforestation can help mitigate global climate change but may have adverse environmental and economic impacts in some regions. For example, economic incentives for carbon sequestration may encourage the expansion of Pinus radiata timber plantations in the Fynbos biome of South Africa, with negative consequences for water supply and biodiversity. I built a dynamic ecological-economic model to investigate whether afforestation of a Fynbos catchment with Pinus radiata is economically viable when the potential benefits of carbon sequestration and timber production are balanced against the losses to water supply. I found that afforestation appears viable to the forestry industry under current water tariffs and current carbon accounting legislation, but would appear unviable if the forestry industry were to pay the true cost of water used by the plantations. I also found that under various plausible future economic scenarios, afforestation can be associated with either large future economic gains or losses, suggesting a need for future analyses based on branches of decision theory that deal with severe uncertainty. I conclude with a general recommendation that climate legislation should be explicit about the conditions under which afforestation for carbon sequestration of native vegetation is a legitimate climate mitigation strategy. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

This chapter documents the growth of input, output, and productivity occurring in different components of the agriculture of colonial and South Korea. The input data include time series of arable acreage, labor, seeds, fertilizer, and agricultural machinery for colonial and South Korea. During 1910--18, when the Cadastral Survey was under way, rice output growth as indicated by the data published by the colonial government probably partly reflects the improved statistical coverage, and thus overstates the actual expansion. Moreover, the colonial authorities revised the method by which rice output was estimated in 1936, causing the official aggregate to jump by 25.8\%. This chapter reproduces the official rice output series side by side with the series adjusted by Sub Park (G59). The pre-1945 and post-1955 agricultural output series presented in this chapter cannot be spliced because the South Korean statistics are based on the improved sampling procedure adopted in 1965.},

  abstract = {Changes in agricultural management strategies have received much attention in recent years with a view to increasing or maintaining the amount of carbon (C) sequestered as soil organic C (SOC). In many parts of the world, minimum or no-till management has been promoted as a means of improving soil quality, reducing losses of erosion and potentially increasing SOC stocks. However, no-till systems can become problematic and potentially disease-prone, especially due to high crop residue loadings. Consequently, residue removal either by harvesting or burning off may be employed to reduce these pressures. Here, we examined the effect of crop residue removal on C storage in soil that had been under no-till management for 20 yr. We predicted improved physical properties (i.e. lower bulk density) and greater microbial activity under the residue retention soils due to greater readily available C and nutrients derived from crop residues. In contrast, we predicted relative reductions in SOC in the no residue soils due to a lack of available residue-derived C for microbial use. Residue removal caused a relative C loss from the soil, which was related to C input, amount of nutrient availability and microbial activity. We demonstrate the importance of maintaining crop residue cover in no-till cropping systems for soil function and highlight the potentially deleterious effects of changing management strategy to increased residue harvesting or removal by burning.},

Two peaks of seasonal CH4 fluxes appeared at the tillering and booting stages and the first peak was higher than the second. The diurnal CH4 fluxes exhibited one peak during tillering stage and two peaks during booting stage in CF and CA treatments, whereas one peak was observed in AWD treatment. The CA and AWD treatments reduced CH4 emissions but increased rice yield than CF treatment in both years. Compared with CF treatment, the average flux in CA and AWD treatments was reduced by 31.75\% and 49.89\% in 2015 and by 28.25\% and 41.97\% in 2016, respectively. The CA and AWD treatments had higher soil redox potentials (Eh), larger methanotrophic pmoA copy numbers, lower soil dehydrogenase activity, lower methanogenic mcrA copy numbers, and lower soil microbial biomass C than CF treatment. Significant positive correlations were observed between the CH4 emissions and the abundance of methanogen, soil dehydrogenase activity, and soil respiration; significant negative correlations were observed between the CH4 emissions and the abundance of methanotrophs, and soil Eh. Our results indicate that an improvement in soil oxygen conditions decreased the abundance of methanogens, increased the abundance of methanotrophs, and improved Eh, thereby contributing to a reduction in the CH4 emissions without affecting rice yield.},

The production and consumption of both gases is determined by the interplay between abiotic (such as oxygen availability) and biotic (such as community structure and trophic interactions) factors.                                                                                             Fish communities play a key role in driving carbon fluxes in benthic and pelagic habitats. Previous studies indicate that trophic interactions in the water column, as well as in the benthic zone can strongly affect aquatic CO                     2                     and CH                     4                     net emissions. However, the overall effect of fish on both pelagic and benthic processes remains largely unresolved, representing the main focus of our experimental study.                                                                                             We evaluated the effects of benthic and pelagic fish on zooplankton and macroinvertebrates; on CO                     2                     and CH                     4                     diffusion and ebullition, as well as on CH                     4                     production and oxidation, using a full-factorial aquarium experiment. We compared five treatments: absence of fish (control); permanent presence of benthivorous fish (common carps, benthic) or zooplanktivorous fish (sticklebacks, pelagic); and intermittent presence of carps or sticklebacks.                                                                                             We found trophic and non-trophic effects of fish on CO                     2                     and CH                     4                     emissions. Intermittent presence of benthivorous fish promoted a short-term increase in CH                     4                     ebullition, probably due to the physical disturbance of the sediment. As CH                     4                     ebullition was the major contributor to the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, incidental bioturbation by benthivorous fish was a key factor triggering total carbon emissions from our aquariums.                                                                                             Trophic effects impacted GHG dynamics in different ways in the water column and the sediment. Fish predation on zooplankton led to a top-down trophic cascade effect on methane-oxidising bacteria. This effect was, however, not strong enough as to substantially alter CH                     4                     diffusion rates. Top-down trophic effects of zooplanktivorous and benthivorous fish on benthic macroinvertebrates, however, were more pronounced. Continuous fish predation reduced benthic macroinvertebrates biomass decreasing the oxygen penetration depth, which in turn strongly reduced water--atmosphere CO                     2                     fluxes while it increased CH                     4                     emission.                                                                                             Our work shows that fish can strongly impact GHG production and consumption processes as well as emission pathways, through trophic and non-trophic effects. Furthermore, our findings suggest their impact on benthic organisms is an important factor regulating carbon (CO                     2                     and CH                     4                     ) emissions.},

  abstract = {Aims: In ecology and conservation biology, the number of species counted in a biodiversity study is a key metric but is usually a biased underestimate of total species richness because many rare species are not detected. Moreover, comparing species richness among sites or samples is a statistical challenge because the observed number of species is sensitive to the number of individuals counted or the area sampled. For individual-based data, we treat a single, empirical sample of species abundances from an investigator-defined species assemblage or community as a reference point for two estimation objectives under two sampling models: estimating the expected number of species (and its unconditional variance) in a random sample of (i) a smaller number of individuals (multinomial model) or a smaller area sampled (Poisson model) and (ii) a larger number of individuals or a larger area sampled. For sample-based incidence (presence-absence) data, under a Bernoulli product model, we treat a single set of species incidence frequencies as the reference point to estimate richness for smaller and larger numbers of sampling units. Methods: The first objective is a problem in interpolation that we address with classical rarefaction (multinomial model) and Coleman rarefaction (Poisson model) for individual-based data and with sample-based rarefaction (Bernoulli product model) for incidence frequencies. The second is a problem in extrapolation that we address with sampling-theoretic predictors for the number of species in a larger sample (multinomial model), a larger area (Poisson model) or a larger number of sampling units (Bernoulli product model), based on an estimate of asymptotic species richness. Although published methods exist for many of these objectives, we bring them together here with some new estimators under a unified statistical and notational framework. This novel integration of mathematically distinct approaches allowed us to link interpolated (rarefaction) curves and extrapolated curves to plot a unified species accumulation curve for empirical examples. We provide new, unconditional variance estimators for classical, individual-based rarefaction and for Coleman rarefaction, long missing from the toolkit of biodiversity measurement. We illustrate these methods with datasets for tropical beetles, tropical trees and tropical ants. Important Findings: Surprisingly, for all datasets we examined, the interpolation (rarefaction) curve and the extrapolation curve meet smoothly at the reference sample, yielding a single curve. Moreover, curves representing 95\% confidence intervals for interpolated and extrapolated richness estimates also meet smoothly, allowing rigorous statistical comparison of samples not only for rarefaction but also for extrapolated richness values. The confidence intervals widen as the extrapolation moves further beyond the reference sample, but the method gives reasonable results for extrapolations up to about double or triple the original abundance or area of the reference sample. We found that the multinomial and Poisson models produced indistinguishable results, in units of estimated species, for all estimators and datasets. For sample-based abundance data, which allows the comparison of all three models, the Bernoulli product model generally yields lower richness estimates for rarefied data than either the multinomial or the Poisson models because of the ubiquity of non-random spatial distributions in nature. {\copyright} 2012 The Author.

In the absence of O2, anaerobic processes such as CH4 production prevail. There is a substantial theoretical knowledge of the biogeochemistry and microbiology of processes in the absence of O2 . Noteworthy are processes involved in the sequential degradation of organic matter coupled with the sequential reduction of electron acceptors, and, finally, the formation of CH4 . These processes follow basic thermodynamic and kinetic principles, but also require the presence of microorganisms as catalysts. Meanwhile, there is a lot of empirical data that combines the observation of process function with the structure of microbial communities. While most of these observations confirmed existing theoretical knowledge, some resulted in new information. One important example was the observation that methanogens, which have been believed to be strictly anaerobic, can tolerate O2 to quite some extent and thus survive desiccation of flooded soil environments amazingly well. Another example is the strong indication of the importance of redox-active soil organic carbon compounds, which may affect the rates and pathways of CH4 production. It is noteworthy that drainage and aeration turns flooded soils, not generally, into sinks for atmospheric CH4, probably due to the peculiarities of the resident methanotrophic bacteria.},

  abstract = {There is virtually no environmental process that is not dependent on temperature. This includes the microbial processes that result in the production of CH4, an important greenhouse gas. Microbial CH4 production is the result of a combination of many different microorganisms and microbial processes, which together achieve the mineralization of organic matter to CO2 and CH4. Temperature dependence applies to each individual step and each individual microbe. This review will discuss the different aspects of temperature dependence including temperature affecting the kinetics and thermodynamics of the various microbial processes, affecting the pathways of organic matter degradation and CH4 production, and affecting the composition of the microbial communities involved. For example, it was found that increasing temperature results in a change of the methanogenic pathway with increasing contribution from mainly acetate to mainly H2/CO2 as immediate CH4 precursor, and with replacement of aceticlastic methanogenic archaea by thermophilic syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacteria plus thermophilic hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea. This shift is consistent with reaction energetics, but it is not obligatory, since high temperature environments exist in which acetate is consumed by thermophilic aceticlastic archaea. Many studies have shown that CH4 production rates increase with temperature displaying a temperature optimum and a characteristic apparent activation energy (Ea). Interestingly, CH4 release from defined microbial cultures, from environmental samples and from wetland field sites all show similar Ea values around 100 kJ mol-1 indicating that CH4 production rates are limited by the methanogenic archaea rather than by hydrolysis of organic matter. Hence, the final rather than the initial step controls the methanogenic degradation of organic matter, which apparently is rarely in steady state.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem services (ES), the benefits that humans obtain from nature, are of great importance for human well-being. The challenge of meeting the growing human demands for natural resources while sustaining essential ecosystem functions and resilience requires an in-depth understanding of the complex relationships between ES. These conflicting (`trade-offs') or synergistic (`synergies') relationships mean that changes in one ES can cause changes in other ES. By synthesizing the growing body of literature on ES relationships, we identified the following four main study objectives: (i) the identification and characterization of co-occurrences of ES, (ii) the identification of drivers that shape ES relationships, (iii) the exploration of biophysical constraints of landscapes and limitations to their multifunctionality, and (iv) the support of environmental planning, management and policy decisions. For each of these objectives we here describe the key concepts, including viewpoints of different disciplines, and highlight the major challenges that need to be addressed. We identified three cross-cutting themes being relevant to all four main types of studies. To help guiding researchers towards more systematic analyses of ES trade-offs and synergies, we conclude with an outlook on suggested future research priorities.},

  abstract = {Soil microbial communities play a pivotal role in regulating ecosystem functioning. But they are increasingly being shaped by human-induced environmental change, including intense ``pulse'' perturbations, such as droughts, which are predicted to increase in frequency and intensity with climate change. While it is known that soil microbial communities are sensitive to such perturbations and that effects can be long-lasting, it remains untested whether there is a threshold in the intensity and frequency of perturbations that can trigger abrupt and persistent transitions in the taxonomic and functional characteristics of soil microbial communities. Here we demonstrate experimentally that intense pulses of drought equivalent to a 30-year drought event ({\textbackslash}textless15\% WHC) induce a major shift in the soil microbial community characterised by significantly altered bacterial and fungal community structures of reduced complexity and functionality. Moreover, the characteristics of this transformed microbial community persisted after returning soil to its previous moisture status. As a result, we found that drought had a strong legacy effect on bacterial community function, inducing an enhanced growth rate following subsequent drought. Abrupt transitions are widely documented in aquatic and terrestrial plant communities in response to human-induced perturbations. Our findings demonstrate that such transitions also occur in soil microbial communities in response to high intensity pulse perturbations, with potentially deleterious consequences for soil health.},

  abstract = {Despite ongoing loss of diversity in freshwater ecosystems, and despite mitigation measures to halt this loss, it is still not clear what ecological drivers underlies lotic biodiversity. A complicating factor is that two of the main drivers, oxygen and temperature, are correlated, and hence studies towards drivers of lotic diversity are confounded. Here, we undertook a systematic review, consisting of both qualitative and quantitative analyses, to disentangle these two drivers. We accessed two literature repositories and assessed papers for eligibility using a set of predetermined criteria. For the qualitative part of this systematic review, we used results on patterns of taxonomic richness and multivariate ordination analyses to expose effects of temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration on biodiversity. For the meta-analysis, we could only use raw data of a few papers in generalized linear models. The qualitative analysis did not show strong consistent effects of either dissolved oxygen concentration or temperature on diversity. However, the meta-analysis showed that taxonomic richness is positively related with dissolved oxygen concentration. Inversely a negative correlation with temperature was found, but adding temperature to a model which already included dissolved oxygen content did not significantly improve the model. These results show the strength of a systematic review and meta-analysis over a conventional review without a meta-analysis; we found no pattern with the qualitative analysis, but a strong pattern with the quantitative analysis.},

Five ecological phases, with contrasting fauna structure, composition, trophic organization and abiotic features, were identified during the pond life. Detritivores and organisms belonging to the group 1 of Wiggins characterized the immature pond. Conductivity and TDS exhibited low values. Fauna and abiotic features of the filling phase and these occurring after spring rains exhibited a certain similarity, revealing a rejuvenation of the pond. In a more mature pond, predators and organisms belonging to the groups 3 and 4 of Wiggins prevailed, but the aquatic macroinvertebrate community differs in relation to season.

This not only requires surveying and modeling many ecosystem services at the same time, but also quantifying the impact of agricultural management and the surrounding landscape on agroecosystem multifunctionality. In this study, we assessed the agroecosystem multifunctionality of 12 organic apple orchards and 12 orchards with integrated pest management (IPM) using field data on 23 indicators for agronomical, ecological and economic performance. Furthermore, the ecological performance indicators were also quantified in 12 semi-natural grasslands to obtain a benchmark for the overall impact of agricultural management on biodiversity and biodiversity-based ecosystem services. We found that organic farming at the field scale had relatively limited beneficial effects on ecological performance, yet it provided farmers with a similar income relative to IPM, despite lower yield levels. Overall orchard multifunctionality did not differ between organic and IPM orchards, regardless of hypothetical stakeholder interests, and a clear trade-off between biodiversity and yield was found within both orchard systems. Structural equation models revealed that in addition to orchard management, also within-orchard location, local biodiversity and characteristics of the surrounding landscape were directly and/or indirectly driving ecosystem service indicator levels. Surrounding semi-natural habitat and landscape complexity enhanced biodiversity and biodiversity-based ecosystem services, and the higher provisioning of several services in the semi-natural benchmark further emphasizes the importance of preserving semi-natural habitats within the agricultural landscape. Overall, our results indicate that reconciling ecological, agronomical and economic goals requires a vision that goes beyond the field-level agricultural management. Therefore, we argue that policy measures should not only address local farm management, but should also target actions towards other stakeholders such as land managers and agricultural markets.},

  abstract = {Climate change is widely recognised as the greatest threat to public health this century, but `climate change and health' often refers to a narrow and limited focus on emissions, and the impacts of the climate crisis, rather than a holistic assessment of economic structures and systems of oppression. This tunnel vision misses key aspects of the climate change and health intersection, such as the enforcers of planetary destruction such as the military, police, and trade, and can also lead down dangerous alleyways such as `net' zero, overpopulation arguments and green extractivism. Tunnel vision also limits health to the absence of the disease at the individual level, rather than sickness or health within systems themselves. Conceptualising health as political, ecological, and collective is essential for tackling the root causes of health injustice. Alternative economic paradigms can offer possibilities for fairer ecological futures that prioritise health and wellbeing. Examples such as degrowth, doughnut economics and ecosocialism, and their relationship with health, are described. The importance of reparations in various forms, to repair previous and ongoing harm, are discussed. Breaking free from tunnel vision is not simply an intellectual endeavour, but a practice. Moving towards new paradigms requires movement building and cultivating radical imagination. The review highlights lessons which can be learnt from abolitionist movements and progressive political struggles across the world. This review provides ideas and examples of how to break free from tunnel vision for climate change and health by highlighting and analysing the work of multiple organisations who are working towards social and economic transformation. Key considerations for the health community are provided, including working in solidarity with others, prioritising community-led solutions, and using our voice, skills, and capacity to address the structural diagnosis---colonial capitalism.},

A series of field experiments was conducted at Ndiaye (shallow water table, dry and wet season) and at Fanaye (deep water table, wet season) in Senegal with four irrigation treatments, involving three water-saving regimes using alternate wetting and drying (AWD) and a flooded control, and three weed management treatments. This was followed by two experiments with the same four irrigation treatments in combination with three nitrogen (N) application rates, at the same locations. Hence four irrigation regimes were tested over three seasons. Between 480 and 1060 mm of irrigation water was used in the water-saving treatments compared with 800-1490 mm in the flooded-rice treatment. Rice yields ranged from 2.3 to 11.8 t ha-1 in the water-saving treatments, whereas in the flooded control the yields ranged from 3.7 to 11.7 t ha-1. In the wet season (WS), the treatments in which AWD was applied during part of the season resulted in the highest yields at both sites. In the dry season (DS), the continuously flooded treatment out-yielded other treatments, with the exception of AWD in Fanaye. At the Ndiaye site, the control of weeds increased yields from on average 2.0 to 7.4 t ha-1 in the DS and from 1.4 to 4.9 t ha-1 in the WS. No weed control in combination with AWD during the vegetative stage reduced yields to below 1.0 t ha-1. However, when weeds were controlled, crop yields obtained with a combination of AWD and flooding were comparable with those obtained in fully flooded plots receiving the same weed management at both sites in the 2005 WS. Increasing rates of N significantly increased grain yield. Internal N efficiency was poorer at Ndiaye than at Fanaye suggesting that yields in Ndiaye are constrained by other factors than N. In Ndiaye, agronomic N use efficiency was smaller in the AWD treatments compared with fully flooded conditions. This study demonstrates that it is possible to save irrigation water and improve water productivity in rice grown in a Sahelian environment. An irrigation regime for rice that starts as conventional (flooded), and then changes to AWD can save water with little or no yield loss, while maintaining low weed pressure and efficient use of N. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The model explicitly incorporates larval and adult dynamics for two species, one of which overgrows the other. Conclusions include: (1) The subordinate must be a stress tolerator or ruderal for coexistence with a competitive dominant. (2) The intermediate disturbance principle is a moderate-to-high settlement phenomenon: coexistence is possible at sufficiently low settlement even without the aid of disturbance, but at high settlement, a dominant with greater benthic ability excludes the subordinate at all levels of disturbance. (3) Given coexistence, increasing disturbance drives the dominant extinct first. (4) For a fixed level of disturbance, an 'intermediate recruitment hypothesis' holds: at low settlement only the subordinate exists, at intermediate settlement there is coexistence, and at high settlement the dominant excludes the subordinate. (5) A gradient in settlement is sufficient to generate benthic zonation, so negative covariation between settlement and disturbance accentuates disturbance's effect, and positive covariation diminishes it. (6) The effects of area and settlement on coexistence in this model are equivalent. (7) Coexistence is favored when the subordinate body size is small compared to the dominant, conditional on larval production.},

  abstract = {Deadwood biomass is one of the five terrestrial carbon pools that are relevant for the estimation of carbon stocks and carbon stock changes under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol (IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories). Statistics on this important ecosystem component are generally provided by national forest inventories: in the last few decades, national forest inventories in Europe have gradually included deadwood among the traditionally investigated components. However, deadwood is generally surveyed in terms of volume, which is then converted to biomass using basic density values. These are rarely specifically derived for the population under estimation; more often, values available from the literature and based on the findings of local studies are used instead. Based on a survey conducted by the Italian national forest inventory in 2008 and 2009 that specifically intended to more deeply investigate the carbon storage of forests, samples of deadwood were collected all over the country from the plots of the national forest inventory network and used to derive basic density values. This paper presents the basic densities obtained for groups of species (conifers, broadleaves), deadwood components (coarse woody debris, standing dead trees, stumps) and decay classes (using a five-class system). Fine woody debris was also surveyed, but in terms of weight and not volume. For such material, the ratio of dry weight to fresh weight for conversion to biomass is presented. In addition, the main aspects of the field protocol are discussed. Lastly, the use of less accurate, generalised basic density values is tested to evaluate its effects on deadwood biomass estimates.},

  abstract = {Double cropping of rice is constrained by tight cropping calendars. In mechanized production systems such as in the Senegal River delta of Africa, drainage date is important for yield, maturity and field trafficability. Randomized complete-block field experiments were conducted at the WARDA research station at Ndiaye in Senegal during the hot-dry and wet seasons to determine effects of drainage date on soil drying, grain yield and assimilate partitioning. The soil was a slightly acid, shrinking clay. Pre-germinated seed of I Kong Pao rice was sown broadcast and the plots kept flooded until drainage at four different dates after flowering (treatments). Topsoil and grain moisture content and the dry weight of panicles, stems, green leaves and dead leaves were measured on six dates between 1st flowering and 2 wk after maturity. Soil moisture content decreased more rapidly under a green canopy than with a mature crop. Grain yield was reduced by 34 to 36\% in both seasons when plots were drained 3 to 4 days after flowering (DAF) (P {$<$} 0.01, compared to drainage at maturity) but were not affected when drained 12 to 14 DAF or later. Grain yield reduction was due one-third to poor grain filling and two-thirds to unfilled spikelets. Maturity (20\% grain moisture content) was advanced 10 to 11 d by early drainage (3 to 4 DAF), compared to drainage at maturity. Apparent mobilization of reserves based on dry weight decrease of vegetative organs after flowering was 32 to 42\% and constituted 46 to 84\% of panicle growth, depending on treatment. Early drainage reduced dry matter production during ripening but did not proportionally affect grain yield because of compensatory mobilization of stem reserves. Models are proposed on the buffering effect of reserves if assimilation during grain filling is variable.},

  abstract = {Agriculture is the largest contributor to biodiversity loss with expanding impacts due to changing consumption patterns and growing populations. Agriculture destroys biodiversity by converting natural habitats to intensely managed systems and by releasing pollutants, including greenhouses gases. Food value chains further amplify impacts including through energy use, transport and waste. Reducing the food system's toll on biodiversity is a critical challenge. The `sparing or sharing' debate contrasts two response pathways: intensifying agriculture to release other land for protection versus biodiversity-friendly farming over larger areas. Most conservation policies focus on intensification and set-aside but recent research challenges these assumptions. The Global Land Outlook of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification highlights how modern farming is undermining the sustainability of large land areas. Intensification has not solved the biodiversity crisis and has often made it worse. Effective responses must involve both producers and consumers, and require a mixture of conservation, sustainable management and restoration. Agricultural land serves many purposes beyond food production and mechanisms are needed to pay farmers for wider stewardship of land resources. A multifunctional landscape approach balances different needs at a landscape scale while incorporating site-level specificity on land use, demand, and condition. At the same time, consumers play a critical role in reducing unsustainable food waste. Many of the techniques and strategies for biodiversity-friendly farming systems exist; the challenge is to bring them to scale.},

  abstract = {Tackling climate change while enhancing biodiversity without compromising production is a main goal in agricultural management. In rice farming, water-saving irrigation techniques alternative to permanent flooding have been globally adopted to face more severe and frequent droughts and have proven effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Yet potential trade-offs with other global concerning environmental issues such as biodiversity conservation are often overlooked. Here we used a field-scale experiment to compare the effects of water management strategies representing a water use gradient (continuous flooding as the lowest intensity water use management; mid-season drainage (MSD) as medium intensity; and alternate wetting and drying (AWD) as the highest intensity management) on i) greenhouse gas emissions, ii) the abundance and diversity of freshwater biological communities, and iii) crop yield. While a positive climate change mitigation effect was observed under water-saving practices (92.5 \% and 67.3 \% methane emission decreases for AWD and MSD, respectively, when compared to continuous flooding), these resulted negative for biodiversity conservation. Even though AWD decreased species richness only at the richness peak, a strong negative effect was observed on the abundance of aquatic organisms (decapods, heteropterans, odonates and amphibians). Grain yield decreased 12.9 \% with AWD management as opposed to continuous flooding but did not vary under MSD. Even though wider adoption of water-saving strategies might help achieving climate mitigation goals while maintaining yields, negative effects on biodiversity should be addressed to preserve highly diverse communities of aquatic organisms and the broad range of ecosystem services they provide. These results point towards marked trade-offs among different agri-environmental issues, therefore, we advocate for more integrative solutions that account for potential side effects when designing alternative water management plans.},

  abstract = {Non-continuous flooding irrigation practices, such as alternate wetting and drying (AWD) and mid-season drainage (MSD), have been implemented in rice agroecosystems to reduce water use and mitigate climate change. Draining fields reduces methane (CH4) emissions, as soil aeration decreases the abundance and activity of soil methanogens. Mitigation effects during the growing season have been widely studied. However, there is a knowledge gap regarding potential effects these growing season practices might have on subsequent fallow season emissions. This is relevant when assessing overall annual CH4 emissions, particularly in systems in which fallow seasons account for a significant part of these. A field experiment was implemented in the Ebro Delta region (Catalonia, Spain) with the objective of identifying potential effects of growing season AWD and MSD on CH4 emitted during the following flooded fallow season, in comparison to continuously flooded fields. Both emissions and the structure of soil microbial communities were analyzed for rice field plots under the assessed irrigation strategies during the growing season and later for a continuously flooded mesocosm across the fallow season. Both practices achieved an average 86\% decrease in CH4 fluxes when compared to continuous flooding during the growing season. AWD resulted in the highest fallow season emissions, leading to increases in overall annual cumulative CH4 emissions (+8\%), global warming potential (+30\%) and yieldscaled global warming potential (+70\%) compared to continuous flooding. Growing season AWD decreased the relative abundance of both methanogens and methanotrophs in the fallow season. Reduced methanotroph communities might lead to lower CH4 consumption, resulting in higher fallow season emissions and offsetting the mitigation effect achieved during the growing season. Under the studied conditions, MSD represented a more effective mitigation strategy. These results highlight the importance of considering both rice growing and fallow season when assessing climate change mitigation strategies.},

A microcosm approach was employed to assess the short-term greenhouse gas emissions from a sandy-loam soil enriched with 18 BBFs in comparison with mineral fertilisers (urea and calcium ammonium nitrate). In total, 20 different fertilisers were homogeneously incorporated into an arable sandy loam soil at a rate of 170 kg nitrogen (N) ha-1 and incubated at 80 \% water-filled pore space. Over 18 days, the fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2) released in the headspace of the microcosms were measured using a Gasera One Multi-gas analyser. Cumulative N2O emissions from the BBF treatments were either comparable or lower (0.04--0.09 \%N applied) than the mineral fertilisers (0.10--0.14 \%N applied). Nitrification of the initial ammonium-N present in the BBFs was likely the dominant biological process driving N2O production. The application of digestate and evaporator concentrates led to an increase in CO2 emissions (8--51 \% of applied carbon (C)), mostly in the first days of the incubation. Meanwhile, the solid fraction of digestate exhibited slow mineralisation patterns (3--7 \% of applied C). The variability in CO2 respiration was strongly influenced by the availability of labile C. Fertilisation had no effect on soil-borne CH4 emissions. Estimation of global warming potential, with respect to added N, suggests that BBFs obtained from the post-digestion treatment of digestate have a lower environmental impact compared to the unprocessed digestate, due to lower N2O emissions.},

Decomposition rates were determined for two diameter classes (1--2 and 8--12{\enspace}cm) and two vertical locations (on and {$>$}20{\enspace}cm above the soil surface). Pacific silver fir and ponderosa pine ecosystems had the lowest k values (0.005 and 0.010 year               -1               , respectively) followed by Douglas-fir (range, 0.004--0.037 year               -1               ) and western hemlock (range, 0.010--0.030 year               -1               ). Small-diameter residues decomposed at rates significantly slower than large-diameter residues in Douglas-fir and western hemlock ecosystems; this relationship was also implied in the other ecosystems. In all four ecosystems, dry season moisture contents were lower in smaller-diameter residues. Moisture levels associated with small-diameter residues were too low for significant decomposition to occur during the dry summer period and probably contributed to the slow annual decay rates. Residues located above the soil surface decomposed significantly slower than residues on the soil surface only in the Douglas-fir ecosystem. Dry season residue moisture, rather than initial lignin concentration, appeared to be the dominant factor determining residue decomposition rates on exposed harvested areas.},

From repeated measurements of the same plots, we estimated change in woody carbon pools as a function of crown fire severity as indicated by a post-fire index, years since fire, pre-fire woody carbon, forest type group (hardwood vs. softwood), elevation, and climate attributes. Our analysis relied on 130 U.S. national forest inventory plots measured before and 1 year after fire, with one additional remeasurement within 6 years after fire. There was no evidence of net change in total wood carbon, defined for this study as the wood in standing trees larger than 12.7 cm diameter at breast height and down wood larger than 7.6 cm in diameter, over the post-fire period in any of the three severity classes. Stands that burned at low severity exhibited considerable shifts from live to standing dead and down wood pools. In stands that burned at moderate severity, live wood decreased significantly whereas no net change was detected in standing dead or down wood. High severity fire burning resulted in movement from standing dead to down wood pools. Our results suggest that the carbon trajectories for stand-replacing fires may not be appropriate for the majority of California's forest area that burned at low to moderate severities.},

  abstract = {Fundamental economic and societal transformations are necessary to avoid dangerous climate change. One broad policy approach that addresses the close relationship between conservation and climate change mitigation is based on correcting a market failure, that is, to establish a price signal for carbon, or more generally, greenhouse gas emissions. While many synergies between climate policy instruments and biodiversity conservation do exist, current policies often fall short of harvesting this potential. Here, we present six key challenges: (1) establishing a strong price signal for greenhouse gas emissions from all emission sources (including land-use and the terrestrial biosphere) that takes into account long-term societal and ecological costs; (2) expand carbon market instruments to cover the full range of greenhouse gases; (3) develop an ambitious, yet accountable architecture for rising emission prices; (4) develop guidelines and ensure enforcement to avoid greenhouse gas leakage; (5) improve greenhouse gas emission measurements from land-use and the biosphere; and (6) integrate emission reduction as a priority into relevant policies. Substantial synergies, but also trade-offs between climate policy and conservation exist, and we identify key risks and challenges. We call for (1) evidence-based evaluations of policy options; (2) avoiding too narrow framings of contested issues such as forest plantations, biofuels, or land-use decisions that exclude (or downplay) indirect effects (e.g., indirect land-use changes or creating carbon debts); and (3) strengthening integrated analyzes beyond sector policy goals. We conclude that avoiding bio-perverse impacts of climate policies on biodiversity will be crucial for the success of global climate change mitigation.

  abstract = {Sea level rise (SLR) produced by climate change affects severely coastal ecosystems which are currently being impacted by sea level rise in many parts of the world. In relation with coastal wetlands, the most relevant induced effect will occur on water and soil's salt content, especially in areas below sea level. This could lead into a reduction of habitat for the wetlands' biota. In this context, this research assesses the SLR related risk in the J{\'u}car River Basin District (JRBD). Hazard, exposure, impact, vulnerability, and risk maps have been elaborated. The design and application of measures is prioritized in those areas classified as Very High risk with the aim of improving coastal ecosystems' climate change adaptation. In Western Mediterranean coast, average sea level (ASL) will rise 0.16 m (2026--2045) and 0.79 m (2081--2100) referred to the reference period (1986--2005). High-end scenarios indicate that ASL will rise 1.35 m--1.92 m (2081--2100). The risk analysis results show that 90\% of JRBD area affected by SLR, corresponds to coastal wetlands. Half of the affected area belongs to L'Albufera de Valencia wetland with 32.44 km2 below sea level, which represents a water volume of 42.64 hm3 (2026--2045) and a surface between 72.53 and 138.96 km2 representing from 118.36 to 289.70 hm3 (2081--2100). In the case of L'Albufera de Valencia the impact will be throughout the 21st century, the average rate of SLR will leap from 4 to 11 cm per decade, therefore MSL will reach the current wetland levels by 2040--2045. This makes necessary to modify the lake's management rules, which will lead to an increase of 40 hm3 in water storage and a reduction in water's renewal time compared to current rates (from 15 to 5 times a year).},

We describe the use of rice fields by waders, gulls, terns, ducks and herons in Italy, Spain, France, Greece and Portugal where this cultivation is most prevalent in certain restricted areas. Rice field systems, including the irrigation canals, are used by a variety of waterbirds, primarily as feeding habitats, and to a lesser extent as breeding sites. The long duration of flooding allows waterbird use through winter in Spain and France; it is limited to spring in other regions. However, the heavy dependence of waterbirds on rice fields is hazardous, because rice cultivation is subject to suddenly changing agricultural practices. Threats include risk from pesticide contamination, changes in the management of rice cultures, the rapidly spreading practice of cultivating rice on dry fields, and from large-scale hydrological changes. We urge authorities to recognize the importance of rice fields for the conservation of Mediterranean waterbirds and propose that cultivation and bird conservation issues be addressed in a holistic fashion.},

The main aim of this study was to explore stakeholders' perceptions on local climate change there and to contrast these perceptions with some of the local meteorological data from the Estartit station (near Aiguamolls de l'Empord{\`a}) and Andravida station (near Kotychi-Strofylia). Semi-structured interviews with thirty-six stakeholders from both coastal wetlands have been conducted with the aim of understanding the perception and constraints facing those currently engaged in a wide range of social, political, environmental and economic activities in both territories. The research results showed that major climate change effects such as increased air temperature, precipitation change, prolonged droughts and shifting seasons were more pronounced over the past twenty years and are of particular concern in both wetlands and their surrounding areas. Moreover, the stakeholders from Spain had a higher awareness of sustainability issues than those from Greece. It is worth mentioning that about two-thirds of the interviewed stakeholders in both areas perceived their coastal wetlands as unsustainable. In addition, stakeholders from the Greek area had higher willingness for not emigrating from their territory than those from Spain. Finally, about half of the stakeholders indicated that they are in favour of natural adaptation measures based on technical solutions such as setting up sand dunes and beach barriers. {\copyright} 2014 Taylor \& Francis.},

  abstract = {Multiple stressors threaten biodiversity and ecosystem integrity, imposing new challenges to ecosystem management and restoration. Ecosystem managers are required to address and mitigate the impact of multiple stressors, yet the knowledge required to disentangle multiple-stressor effects is still incomplete. Experimental studies have advanced the understanding of single and combined stressor effects, but there is a lack of a robust analytical framework, to address the impact of multiple stressors based on monitoring data. Since 2000, the monitoring of Europe's waters has resulted in a vast amount of biological and environmental (stressor) data of about 120,000 water bodies. For many reasons, this data is rarely exploited in the multiple-stressor context, probably because of its rather heterogeneous nature: stressors vary and are mixed with broad-scale proxies of environmental stress (e.g. land cover), missing values and zero-inflated data limit the application of statistical methods and biological indicators are often aggregated (e.g. taxon richness) and do not respond stressor-specific. Here, we present a `cookbook' to analyse the biological response to multiple stressors using data from biomonitoring schemes. Our `cookbook' includes guidance for the analytical process and the interpretation of results. The `cookbook' is accompanied by scripts, which allow the user to run a stepwise analysis based on his/her own data in R, an open-source language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. Using simulated and real data, we show that the recommended procedure is capable of identifying stressor hierarchy (importance) and interaction in large datasets. We recommend a minimum number of 150 independent observations and a minimum stressor gradient length of 75\% (of the most relevant stressor's gradient in nature), to be able to reliably rank the stressor's importance, detect relevant interactions and estimate their standardised effect size. We conclude with a brief discussion of the advantages and limitations of this protocol.},

These changes are motivated by the need to adapt to the uncertainties and risks of climate change, and by the need to enlist their carbon storage and sequestration capacity as part of global mitigation efforts. These changes do however raise concerns regarding the potential implications for forest biodiversity. Here we evaluate these concerns by assessing the biodiversity implications of climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies (CCAMS) being implemented in the production forests of Sweden. We do so by identifying biodiversity goals aimed specifically at closing the existing gap between the habitat requirements of forest-dependent species, and the conditions provided by production forests, in terms of tree species composition, forest structures, and spatio-temporal forest patterns. We then use the existing literature to determinewhether and bywhich pathway each CCAMS is likely to bridge or extend this gap. Our results indicate that CCAMS will often come into direct or partial conflict with Swedish biodiversity goals in production forests. Furthermore, some CCAMS which are inconsistent with biodiversity goals, such as logging residue removal, are being implemented more extensively than those which were most consistent with biodiversity goals. We nevertheless challenge the necessity of setting the preservation of forest biodiversity against climate change mitigation and adaptation. Weclarify howCCAMS with negative biodiversity implications may still be implemented without adverse outcomes, if coupled with conservation interventions, or combined with other CCAMS deemed complementary in habitat provision.},

Zero-inflated or hurdle models are often used to fit such data. Despite the increasing popularity of ZI and hurdle models, there is still a lack of investigation of the fundamental differences between these two types of models. In this article, we reviewed the zero-inflated and hurdle models and highlighted their differences in terms of their data generating processes. We also conducted simulation studies to evaluate the performances of both types of models. The final choice of regression model should be made after a careful assessment of goodness of fit and should be tailored to a particular data in question.},

Methods and Results: A novel type I, related to the genus Methylococcus, and three type II methanotrophs were isolated from the highest positive dilution steps from the most probable number (MPN) counts. Potential methane oxidation activities measured in slurried samples were higher in the rhizospheric soil compared to the SWI and were stimulated by N-fertilization. PmoA (particulate methane monooxygenase) clone libraries were constructed for both rice microsites. SWI clones clustered in six groups related to cultivated and uncultivated members from different ecosystems of the genera Methylobacter, Methylomonas, Methylococcus and a novel type I sublineage while cultivation and T-RFLP (terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism) analysis confirmed the presence of type II methanotrophs. Conclusions: Cultivation techniques, cloning analysis and T-RFLP fingerprinting of the pmoA gene revealed a diverse methanotrophic community in the rice rhizospheric soil and SWI.

  abstract = {Alternate wetting and drying (AWD), has gained increasing attention as a promising strategy for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in flooded rice systems. AWD involves periodic drainage of rice paddies in order to inhibit methane (CH 4 ) emissions. To date, studies evaluating this practice have been limited in their scope and resolution. Our study evaluates the mitigation potential of AWD from a life cycle perspective using high-resolution CH 4 modeling to more accurately estimate the mitigation potential of this practice. We simulated California rice production under continuous flooding and under five AWD schedules ranging in the severity and frequency of dry-downs. Production models were coupled with the Peatland Ecosystem Photosynthesis Respiration and Methane Transport (PEPRMT) model to simulate CH 4 fluxes at daily intervals. We then evaluated the GHG mitigation potential of AWD using life cycle assessment models. Frequent or severe dry-downs reduced simulated grain yields, which negated some of the benefits of AWD when assessed on a yield-scaled basis. We also found AWD-induced mitigation of CH 4 emissions modeled with PEPRMT to be roughly half the magnitude reported from up-scaling of chamber measurements, highlighting the importance of high resolution field data to better characterize GHGs in rice systems. Reduced yields and conservative CH 4 mitigation in our model lessened the overall mitigation potential of AWD. When the entire rice life cycle was considered, mitigation of overall global warming potential (GWP) was further reduced by the presence of additional GHG sources, which comprised roughly half of life cycle GWP. Our simulations resulted in {$\leq$}12\% reductions in GWP kg -1 across all AWD scenarios and saw an increase in GWP when yields were severely reduced. Our results highlight the importance of constraining uncertainties in CH 4 emissions and considering a life cycle perspective expressed on a yield-scaled basis in characterizing the mitigation potential of AWD.},

These changes were hypothesized to alter soil carbon cycling pathways across the region. The principal objective of this study was to determine how various winter fallowed straw and water management changes would affect year-round methane emissions. Main plots were winter flood and nonflood, and subplots had straw treatments: burned, soil incorporated, or rolled (partially soil incorporated). Results showed the principal factor controlling methane emissions was the interaction of flooding and straw amendments. The presence of either water or straw alone led to low emissions. Winter emissions accounted for 50\% of annual totals in straw-amended treatments despite lower temperatures and the presence of plants in summer. Summer emissions were significantly influenced by winter straw amendments but not by winter flood. Postdrain peaks after winter drain accounted for 10-13\% of annual emissions in treatments with amended straw. Although rolled and incorporated treatments had similar straw inputs, methane fluxes from rolled treatments were higher than from incorporated treatments. Measurements of methane should be conducted year-round to capture fallow and postdrain fluxes and improve global emission estimates. Regional emission estimates showed that 2.6 times more methane was emitted after flooding plus incorporation was implemented than before the legislative mandate was enacted.},

As a new step in this endeavor, we asked how plant species richness relates to productivity in a natural ecosystem. Here, we report on an experiment conducted in a natural ecosystem in the Patagonian steppe, in which we assessed the biodiversity effect on primary production. Using a plant species diversity gradient generated by removing species while maintaining constant biomass, we found that aboveground net primary production increased with the number of plant species. We also found that the biodiversity effect was larger in natural than in artificial ecosystems.

  abstract = {Conservation of soil organic carbon (SOC) is important for improving soil quality. Increasing the pool of particulate organic carbon (POC), thought to have a "slow" or medium turnover rate, with conservation tillage may be a critical step in improving the quality of agricultural soils. We determined the standing stock and potential mineralization rate of POC (defined as material {$>$}53 {\textbar}xm diam.) at depths of 0 to 50,50 to 125,and 125 to 200 mm in four Boralfs (loam, silt loam, clay loam, and clay) under conventional shallow tillage (CT) and 4 to 16 yr of zero tillage (ZT) in northern Alberta and British Columbia. Standing stock of POC was consistently different between tillage regimes only at a depth of 0 to 50 mm, averaging 0.63kg m 2 under CT and 0.76kg m{\textasciitilde}2 under ZT. However, the ratio of specific POC mineralization to specific whole-SOC mineralization averaged 23\% greater under ZT than under CT, suggesting that POC was of higher quality (i.e., more mineralizable) under ZT relative to other pools of SOC. With increasing clay content of the original soil, specific mineralization rate of POC increased after clay was removed by dispersion. This result suggests that clay may play an important role in sequestering POC by protecting its decomposition. Particulate organic C content was a more sensitive indicator of tillage-induced changes in SOC than the total amount of SOC. Zero tillage in this cold semiarid climate may increase both the active and slow pools of SOC within several years.},

  abstract = {Down woody debris (DWD) plays a vital role in forest ecosystem structure and function. Although volume is likely the most common metric used to characterize DWD, an evaluation of the formulae used for volume estimation on individual DWD pieces has received little attention. We determined actual volume of 155 diverse DWD pieces (types, species, lengths, and diameters) by detailed field measurements. By comparing the actual and calculated volumes from six commonly used formulae, we assessed their bias, precision, and accuracy. Based on observed DWD forms, we developed a new formula, namely the ``conic--paraboloid'', which was included in the assessment. Among the formulae that require length and two end diameter measurements, the conic--paraboloid had the lowest bias, highest precision, and hence greatest accuracy. Newton's and the centroid formulae had higher accuracy yet require more field measurements. Smalian's, conical frustum, and average-of-ends formulae had poor performance relative to the others. Accuracy of all formulae decreased with increasing piece length. Thus, partitioning pieces into two, three, and four sections for additional measurement improved accuracy. As decay advances, pieces become progressively more elliptical in cross section. Using the cross-sectional area derived from only the long axis of the ellipse leads to substantial volume overestimates for well-decayed DWD.

Progress in this field is hindered by the long time-scales inherent to the low decay rates of wood and the lack of short-term methods to assess long-term decomposition dynamics in standardized field conditions.                                         2.               {\enspace}Here, we present such a method, which relies on the sampling and short-term incubation of wood from several decay stages covering the entire decay process. Together these short-term decay steps are used to model and discriminate between three potential decay dynamics (linear, exponential and sigmoid) using an iterative optimization procedure. We applied this method to analyse long-term wood decay of six subarctic tree species (six stems and two roots) and test the hypotheses that (i) different wood species follow distinct decay dynamics and (ii) interspecific variation in wood traits controls variation in wood decay rates in a standardized environment.                                         3.               {\enspace}We found interspecific variation in long-term wood decay dynamics: decay of               Alnus               and               Salix               stems was best described by exponential models, whereas decay of               Sorbus               stems and               Betula               and               Pinus               roots was best fitted by linear models and               Betula               ,               Pinus               and               Populus               stems each displayed a sigmoid decay dynamics (up to 5-year initial lag phase). A six-fold variation was observed between the decomposition half-lives of all eight wood types, from 6.8{$\quad$}years (6.1--7.5, 95\% C.I.) for               Alnus               stems to 41.3{$\quad$}years (34.5--51.8) for               Pinus               roots. Initial wood traits such as pH (               R               2               {$\quad$}={$\quad$}0.92), dry matter content (               R               2               {$\quad$}={$\quad$}0.79) and lignin (               R               2               {$\quad$}={$\quad$}0.73) were good predictors of long-term wood decay rates.                                         4.               {\enspace}               Synthesis.               Our findings suggest changing decay dynamics across wood species and types that are likely to arise from changing underlying wood decay processes (i.e. varying wood functional traits/decomposer community interactions). Our new method, which combines advantages of direct observations and the chronosequence approach, allows reliable comparisons of species contributions to long-term wood decay rates and provides future opportunities to experimentally disentangle intrinsic and external abiotic and biotic drivers of long-term wood decay processes.},

Meanwhile, food security is a high-priority area in the UN Sustainable Development Goals, which could potentially be adversely affected by stringent climate mitigation. Here we show the potential negative trade-offs between food security and climate mitigation using a multi-model comparison exercise. We find that carelessly designed climate mitigation policies could increase the number of people at risk of hunger by 160 million in 2050. Avoiding these adverse side effects would entail a cost of about 0.18\% of global gross domestic product in 2050. It should be noted that direct impacts of climate change on yields were not assessed and that the direct benefits from mitigation in terms of avoided yield losses could be substantial, further reducing the above cost. Although results vary across models and model implementations, the qualitative implications are robust and call for careful design of climate mitigation policies taking into account agriculture and land prices.},

A field experiment was conducted at the International Rice Research Institute, Philippines, in 2010-2011 using a temperature free-air controlled enhancement (T-FACE) system. Our objectives were to assess (i) the suitability of the T-FACE system for flooded rice fields and (ii) seasonal variations in greenhouse gas emissions with and without experimental warming.This observation period included one wet season (WS), one dry season (DS), and a fallow season. The experimental warming, i.e., T-FACE system, was maintained by using six infrared heaters deployed in a hexagonal pattern over each plot (7.1m2). Set-point canopy temperatures of the warming treatment were 1.5 and 3.0{$^\circ$}C higher than the reference plots during daytime and nighttime, respectively. Two warming treatments (i.e., heated and reference) were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Infrared warming increased rice canopy temperature by 1.1 and 2.6{$^\circ$}C (0.4{$^\circ$}C below the targeted set-point) during daytime and nighttime, respectively. On the other hand, only a marginal (0.4-0.5{$^\circ$}C) increase was observed for both water and soil temperatures, likely because flood irrigation water flowed across the field. The warming (elevated canopy temperature) had no significant effects on CH4 or N2O emissions during the dry, wet, and fallow seasons. However, diel and seasonal variations in CH4 emissions were observed during the rice-growing and fallow periods. CH4 emissions were higher during the early afternoons, which was positively correlated with both soil and air temperatures. Similarly, CH4 emission rates increased with rice growth stage up to the reproductive stage. Moreover, cumulative CH4 emissions were 1.5 times higher in the 2011 DS than in the 2010 WS (50 and 34gCH4m-2, respectively). The 2-month fallow season (late May-early July 2011) under continuous flooding emitted 51gCH4m-2, which is similar to that in the 2011 DS. On the other hand, N2O emissions were not detected throughout the growing season, but an emission peak was observed after final drainage at maturity during the 2011 DS. Both rice-growing and fallow seasons were the major sources of CH4 emissions as long as the field was continuously flooded, while N2O was not detectable in continuously flooded soil. Infrared warming did not affect rice yields or yield components, probably because the general growing temperatures were near optimum, and the warming treatment was not sufficiently large to cause a significant effect. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The general idea is intuitively appealing: since all species are to some extent unique, each will be important for a different set of functions. Therefore, as more functions are considered, a greater diversity of species is necessary to sustain all functions simultaneously. However, we show here that the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning does not change with the number of functions considered. Biodiversity affects the level of multifunctionality via non-additive effects on individual functions, and the effect on multifunctionality equals the average effect on single functions. These insights run counter to messages in the literature. In the light of our simulations, we present limitations and pitfalls with current methods used to study biodiversity-multifunctionality, which together provide a perspective for future studies.},

This review develops an analytic framework to characterize the fulfilment of these objectives by documenting the co-occurrence of positive, neutral, and negative outcomes for crop yield and nine regulating ecosystem services. We provide an illustrative examination of the framework, evaluating evidence for yield and ecosystem service outcomes across five AEI systems: conservation agriculture, holistic grazing management, organic agriculture, precision agriculture, and system of rice intensification (SRI). We reviewed 104 studies containing 245 individual comparisons between AEI and contrasting farming systems. In three of the five AEI systems, conservation agriculture, precision agriculture, and SRI, more than half of reviewed comparisons reported `win-win' outcomes, enhancement of both yield and ecosystem services, or `win-neutral' outcomes relative to contrasting farming systems. The review presents substantial evidence that the five AEI systems can contribute to multi-functional agriculture by increasing ecosystem service provision, or reducing negative externalities associated with agriculture, while maintaining or increasing yields. A framework such as the one presented here can help guide decision-makers considering how best to implement multi-functional agriculture so that both crop yield and ecosystem service delivery can be maintained or increased.},

Although the residual index is similar to an analysis of covariance (                     ancova                     ), it is not identical and is incorrect for at least four reasons:                                                                                             {\enspace}the regression coefficient used by the residual index differs from the one used in                     ancova                     and is not the least-squares estimator of the model.                                                                                             in contrast to the                     ancova                     , the error d.f. in the residual index are overestimated because of the estimation of the regression coefficient.                                                                                             the residual index also assumes the homogeneity of regression coefficients (parallelism assumption), which should be tested with a special                     ancova                     design.                                                                        even if the assumptions of the linear model hold for the original variables, they will not hold for the residuals.                                                                          More importantly, the residual index is an                     ad hoc                     sequential procedure with no statistical justification, unlike the well-known                     ancova                     . For these reasons, I suggest that a                     t                     -test or an                     anova                     of the residuals should never be used in place of an                     ancova                     to study condition or any other variable.},

  abstract = {Agriculture is in crisis. Soil health is collapsing. Biodiversity faces the sixth mass extinction. Crop yields are plateauing. Against this crisis narrative swells a clarion call for Regenerative Agriculture. But what is Regenerative Agriculture, and why is it gaining such prominence? Which problems does it solve, and how? Here we address these questions from an agronomic perspective. The term Regenerative Agriculture has actually been in use for some time, but there has been a resurgence of interest over the past 5 years. It is supported from what are often considered opposite poles of the debate on agriculture and food. Regenerative Agriculture has been promoted strongly by civil society and NGOs as well as by many of the major multi-national food companies. Many practices promoted as regenerative, including crop residue retention, cover cropping and reduced tillage are central to the canon of `good agricultural practices', while others are contested and at best niche (e.g. permaculture, holistic grazing). Worryingly, these practices are generally promoted with little regard to context. Practices most often encouraged (such as no tillage, no pesticides or no external nutrient inputs) are unlikely to lead to the benefits claimed in all places. We argue that the resurgence of interest in Regenerative Agriculture represents a re-framing of what have been considered to be two contrasting approaches to agricultural futures, namely agroecology and sustainable intensification, under the same banner. This is more likely to confuse than to clarify the public debate. More importantly, it draws attention away from more fundamental challenges. We conclude by providing guidance for research agronomists who want to engage with Regenerative Agriculture.},

This type of analysis requires information on future pathways of land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) under different socio-economic conditions and policy settings. For this purpose, the spatially explicit land-use change model LandSHIFT was applied to calculate a set of high-resolution land-use change scenarios for the Brazilian states Para and Mato Grosso. The period of the analysis were the years 2010--2030. The resulting landuse maps were combined with maps depicting vertebrate species diversity in order to examine the impact of natural habitat loss on species ranges as well as the overall LULCCinduced effect on vertebrate diversity as expressed by the Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII). The results of this study indicate a general decrease in biodiversity intactness in all investigated scenarios. However, agricultural intensification combined with diversified environmental protection policies show least impact of LULCC on vertebrate species richness and conservation of natural habitats compared to scenarios with low agricultural intensification or scenarios with less effective conservation policies.},

We sampled 12 stream sites in three zones of Portugal, differing in climate geomorphology and water chemistry. At a sampling unit scale, substratum organic matter content, depth and the dominant size of substratum particles were correlated with numbers of taxa and individuals. We propose that the number of taxa at a small scale depends on the number of individuals, which in turn is the result of organic matter accumulation, hydrologic and substratum characteristics. The environmental parameters better explaining the large-scale biological data were temperature, minimum size of substratum particles and pH. Regardless of the relative importance of variable types and mechanisms regulating stream invertebrates along the climatic gradient, rivers from the North and Centre appeared to be richer in taxa than the typically Mediterranean streams in the South. {\copyright} 2004 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

  abstract = {Microorganisms are vital in mediating the earth's biogeochemical cycles; yet, despite our rapidly increasing ability to explore complex environmental microbial communities, the relationship between microbial community structure and ecosystem processes remains poorly understood. Here, we address a fundamental and unanswered question in microbial ecology: `When do we need to understand microbial community structure to accurately predict function?' We present a statistical analysis investigating the value of environmental data and microbial community structure independently and in combination for explaining rates of carbon and nitrogen cycling processes within 82 global datasets. Environmental variables were the strongest predictors of process rates but left 44\% of variation unexplained on average, suggesting the potential for microbial data to increase model accuracy. Although only 29\% of our datasets were significantly improved by adding information on microbial community structure, we observed improvement in models of processes mediated by narrow phylogenetic guilds via functional gene data, and conversely, improvement in models of facultative microbial processes via community diversity metrics. Our results also suggest that microbial diversity can strengthen predictions of respiration rates beyond microbial biomass parameters, as 53\% of models were improved by incorporating both sets of predictors compared to 35\% by microbial biomass alone. Our analysis represents the first comprehensive analysis of research examining links between microbial community structure and ecosystem function. Taken together, our results indicate that a greater understanding of microbial communities informed by ecological principles may enhance our ability to predict ecosystem process rates relative to assessments based on environmental variables and microbial physiology.},

  abstract = {The goal of this study was to map rainfed and irrigated rice-fallow cropland areas across South Asia, using MODIS 250 m time-series data and identify where the farming system may be intensified by the inclusion of a short-season crop during the fallow period. Rice-fallow cropland areas are those areas where rice is grown during the kharif growing season (June--October), followed by a fallow during the rabi season (November--February). These cropland areas are not suitable for growing rabi-season rice due to their high water needs, but are suitable for a short -season ({$\leq$}3 months), low water-consuming grain legumes such as chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), black gram, green gram, and lentils. Intensification (double-cropping) in this manner can improve smallholder farmer's incomes and soil health via rich nitrogen-fixation legume crops as well as address food security challenges of ballooning populations without having to expand croplands. Several grain legumes, primarily chickpea, are increasingly grown across Asia as a source of income for smallholder farmers and at the same time providing rich and cheap source of protein that can improve the nutritional quality of diets in the region. The suitability of rainfed and irrigated rice-fallow croplands for grain legume cultivation across South Asia were defined by these identifiers: (a) rice crop is grown during the primary (kharif) crop growing season or during the north-west monsoon season (June--October); (b) same croplands are left fallow during the second (rabi) season or during the south-east monsoon season (November--February); and (c) ability to support low water-consuming, short-growing season ({$\leq$}3 months) grain legumes (chickpea, black gram, green gram, and lentils) during rabi season. Existing irrigated or rainfed crops such as rice or wheat that were grown during kharif were not considered suitable for growing during the rabi season, because the moisture/water demand of these crops is too high. The study established cropland classes based on the every 16-day 250 m normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series for one year (June 2010--May 2011) of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, using spectral matching techniques (SMTs), and extensive field knowledge. Map accuracy was evaluated based on independent ground survey data as well as compared with available sub-national level statistics.

  abstract = {Soil stability and aggregates are important drivers of soil fertility and microbial diversity and are highly vulnerable to land degradation. However, the role of soil aggregates in driving the responses of microbial functional diversity and multiple ecosystem services and functions (multifunctionality) to further degradation (e.g., fertilization) remains largely unexplored and poorly understood. In this study, we used soils from long-term experiments involving inorganic and organic fertilization treatments to investigate the role soil aggregates (microscale) play in driving microbial functional gene diversity (via GeoChip) and the activity of multiple extracellular enzymes in an agricultural ecosystem. We found that microbial functional gene diversity has a significant and positive relationship with soil multifunctionality, which is enhanced in soil aggregates by organic fertilizer but is reduced by inorganic fertilizer. We also found that soil aggregate fractions indirectly controlled multiple ecosystem functions via changes in functional diversity. Smaller soil aggregates with higher resource availability (carbon and nitrogen) supported more ecological functions than larger aggregates under contrasting fertilizer management regimes. Soil multifunctionality is regulated by the differences in resource availability and not by microbial functional gene composition, which suggests that microbial functional diversity contributed more to multifunctionality than gene composition. Random forest analysis and structural equation modeling indicated that soil carbon and nitrogen and microbial functional diversity together determined the multifunctionality, whereas soil traits have more standardized total effects than functional diversity. Our study highlights that soil aggregation stratifies soil nutrition and microbial functional diversity, which leads to the differentiation of aggregate ecosystem multifunctionality.},

Investigations of the effect of the straw return on GHG emissions and SOCS under different water management regimes help clarify the strategy to alleviate the comprehensive greenhouse effect of paddy fields. Therefore, a two-year field experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of different water and straw management on GHG emissions, SOCS, and rice yield. The greenhouse effect of paddy fields was quantified by calculating the greenhouse gas emission intensity (GHGI) and net greenhouse gas emission (NGHGE). The field experiment included four treatments: CI: controlled irrigation + straw removal; FI: flooded irrigation + straw removal; CI+SR: controlled irrigation + straw return; and FI+SR: flooded irrigation + straw return. The results showed that straw return could increase the SOCS and rice yield of paddy fields under different water management regimes, and the average SOCS and rice yield of CI+SR were higher than FI+SR. Furthermore, compared with FI, FI+SR promoted the GHG emission and increased the average global warming potential by 36.37\%, which significantly increased the average GHGI and NGHGE by 19.95\% and 22.63\%, respectively. However, the global warming potential of CI+SR had no significant difference with FI due to water-saving irrigation could mitigate CH4 emissions, which caused the average GHGI and NGHGE decrease by 22.02\% and 38.45\%, respectively. Therefore, straw return combined with water-saving irrigation is an effective strategy to alleviate the comprehensive greenhouse effect of paddy fields.},

These bacteria are classified into three groups based on the pathways used for assimilation of formaldehyde, the major source of cell carbon, and other physiological and morphological features. The type I and type X methanotrophs are found within the gamma subdivision of the Proteobacteria and employ the ribulose monophosphate pathway for formaldehyde assimilation, whereas type II methanotrophs, which employ the serine pathway for formaldehyde assimilation, form a coherent cluster within the beta subdivision of the Proteobacteria. Methanotrophic bacteria are ubiquitous. The growth of type II bacteria appears to be favored in environments that contain relatively high levels of methane, low levels of dissolved oxygen, and limiting concentrations of combined nitrogen and/or copper. Type I methanotrophs appear to be dominant in environments in which methane is limiting and combined nitrogen and copper levels are relatively high. These bacteria serve as biofilters for the oxidation of methane produced in anaerobic environments, and when oxygen is present in soils, atmospheric methane is oxidized. Their activities in nature are greatly influenced by agricultural practices and other human activities. Recent evidence indicates that naturally occurring, uncultured methanotrophs represent new genera. Methanotrophs that are capable of oxidizing methane at atmospheric levels exhibit methane oxidation kinetics different from those of methanotrophs available in pure cultures. A limited number of methanotrophs have the genetic capacity to synthesize a soluble methane monooxygenase which catalyzes the rapid oxidation of environmental pollutants including trichloroethylene.},

The combined effects of water management and different organic manure application on methane emission, carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide fluxes, emission factor (EF) and WP are not well documented, which has been evaluated during dry seasons of 2018 and 2019. AWD and continuous flooding (CF) were imposed in NPKSZn, cowdung (CD), poultry manure (PM) and vermicompost (VC) treated plots. Closed chamber techniques were used for determining emissions of greenhouse gases. In comparison with CF, the AWD significantly reduced total GWP by 15--44\% depending on soil amendments and 2--29\% net ecosystem carbon balance (CO2); but additional N2O contribution to GWP was about 0.61--1.18\% compared to sole chemical fertilizer treatments. Depending on soil amendments, the AWD reduced EF of CH4 (22--36\%) but increased WP by 25--27\% compared to CF system along with 14--43\% reduction in GHG intensity (GHGI). Vermicompost treatment had the lowest GHG emission, GWP, EF and GHGI than cowdung, poultry manure under both irrigation methods. Rice yield varied because of soil amendments but not with irrigation methods. Use of vermicompost improved soil organic carbon (SOC) storage significantly than cowdung and poultry manure. In conclusion, AWD practice and amendment of rice soil with vermicompost could be an effective strategy for reducing GHG emission, GWP, EF and GHGI without sacrificing rice yield.},

  abstract = {Background: Forests are an important component of the global carbon (C) cycle and can be net sources or sinks of CO2, thus mitigating or exacerbating the effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. While forest productivity is often inferred from national-scale yield tables or from satellite products, forest C emissions resulting from dead organic matter decay are usually simulated, therefore it is important to ensure the accuracy and reliability of a model used to simulate organic matter decay at an appropriate scale. National Forest Inventories (NFIs) provide a record of carbon pools in ecosystem components, and these measurements are essential for evaluating rates and controls of C dynamics in forest ecosystems. In this study we combine the observations from the Swiss NFIs and machine learning techniques to quantify the decay rates of the standing snags and downed logs and identify the main controls of dead wood decay. Results: We found that wood decay rate was affected by tree species, temperature, and precipitation. Dead wood originating from Fagus sylvatica decayed the fastest, with the residence times ranging from 27 to 54 years at the warmest and coldest Swiss sites, respectively. Hardwoods at wetter sites tended to decompose faster compared to hardwoods at drier sites, with residence times 45--92 and 62--95 years for the wetter and drier sites, respectively. Dead wood originating from softwood species had the longest residence times ranging from 58 to 191 years at wetter sites and from 78 to 286 years at drier sites. Conclusions: This study illustrates how long-term dead wood observations collected and remeasured during several NFI campaigns can be used to estimate dead wood decay parameters, as well as gain understanding about controls of dead wood dynamics. The wood decay parameters quantified in this study can be used in carbon budget models to simulate the decay dynamics of dead wood, however more measurements (e.g. of soil C dynamics at the same plots) are needed to estimate what fraction of dead wood is converted to CO2, and what fraction is incorporated into soil.},

To understand how much woody detritus is required to sustain ecosystem functions, we need to develop a dynamic and specific objective-oriented approach.

  abstract = {Background: Recent increases in forest tree mortality should increase the abundance coarse woody detritus (CWD) and ultimately lead to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide. However, the time course of carbon release from CWD is not well understood. We compiled CWD decomposition rate-constants (i.e., k) to examine how tree species, piece diameter, position (i.e., standing versus downed), canopy openness, and macroclimate influenced k. To illustrate their implications we modeled the effect of species and position on estimates of decomposition-related carbon flux. We examined a subset of currently used models to determine if their structure accounted for these factors. Results: Globally k of downed CWD varied at least 244-fold with interspecies variation at individual sites up to 76-fold. While k generally decreased with increasing piece diameter, under open canopies the opposite occurred. Standing CWD sometimes exhibited little decomposition, but sometimes had k values up to 3 times faster than downed CWD. There was a clear response of k to mean annual temperature of {$\approx$} 2.6 times per 10 {\textcelsius}; however, there was considerable variation for a given mean annual temperature related to species, diameter, and position. A key feature of carbon release from CWD after disturbance was the ``evolution'' of the ecosystem-level k value as positions and species mixtures of the remaining CWD changed. Variations in decomposition caused by disturbance (e.g., changes in species, positions, sizes, and microclimate) had the potential to cause net carbon fluxes to the atmosphere to be highly nonlinear. While several models currently being used for carbon accounting and assessing land-use/climate change would potentially capture some of these post disturbance changes in fluxes and carbon balances, many would not. Conclusions: While much has been learned in the last 5 decades about CWD decomposition, to fully understand the time course of carbon release from increased mortality and other aspects of global change a new phase of global CWD research that is more systematic, experimental, and replicated needs to be initiated. If our findings are to be fully applied in modeling, an approach acknowledging how the rate of carbon release evolves over time should be implemented.},

To reverse subsidence and capture carbon there is increasing interest in converting drained agricultural land-use types to flooded conditions. Rice agriculture is proposed as a flooded land-use type with CO 2 sequestration potential for this region. We conducted two years of simultaneous eddy covariance measurements at a conventional drained and grazed degraded peatland and a newly converted rice paddy to evaluate the impact of drained to flooded land-use change on CO 2, CH 4, and evaporation fluxes.We found that the grazed degraded peatland emitted 175-299g-Cm -2yr -1 as CO 2 and 3.3g-Cm -2yr -1 as CH 4, while the rice paddy sequestered 84-283g-Cm -2yr -1 of CO 2 from the atmosphere and released 2.5-6.6g-Cm -2yr -1 as CH 4. The rice paddy evaporated 45-95\% more water than the grazed degraded peatland. Annual photosynthesis was similar between sites, but flooding at the rice paddy inhibited ecosystem respiration, making it a net CO 2 sink. The rice paddy had reduced rates of soil subsidence due to oxidation compared with the drained peatland, but did not completely reverse subsidence. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The paddy was visited regularly for eighteen months, and the pattern of seasonal succession was studied. The major biological characteristics were noted including relative abundance of the 205 species observed. A few species were consistantly common whenever there was sufficient water in the paddy, but most had well defined seasonal periods during which they were abundant and actively propagating. In time the number of individuals of these dominant species declined and other species replaced them. During the part of the year that the field was flooded, four distinct aggregations of species succeeded each other. Thus, in the biological year of the rice paddy, two primary phases, dry and wet, were easily discernible, and within the wet phase, four periods could be defined by the successive aggregations of species. The species identified were similar to those reported to occur in the rice paddies of Northeast Thailand, but biological studies of Laos have been so infrequent that most species are reported for the first time from Laos, hence extending their geographical ranges.},

  abstract = {An overview is given of the different indices used, since their introduction in the 60's, for the determination of diversity in biological samples and communities. The most commonly used indices are based on the estimation of relative abundance of species in samples. Relative abun- dance can also be used for either a graphical or a mathematical represen- tation of species-abundance relationships, from which diversity indices can be deduced as well. Most common in the literature are indices either describing the richness or species number and the evenness or parti- tioning of individuals over species or a combination of both. The most commonly used diversity indices can be grouped in a coherent system of diversity numbers developed by HILL (1973) that includes species richness, the Simpson index and a derivation of the Shannon-Wiener index as special cases. In this system species are different only when their abundance is different. Therefore, during the last decade a number of indices have been developed that take into account the taxonomic position, trophic status or body size of the species. There is as yet no consensus as to the use of evenness indices. We apply the condition that evenness should be independent of species richness (HElP, 1974). The number of potential evenness indices is then strongly reduced. It is argued that the calculation of diversity or evenness indices should simply serve as descriptors of community structure and be complemented with information on ecological functioning},

  abstract = {Many species have adapted successfully to traditionally cultivated agricultural environments but, as production systems are intensified, this adaptation is reaching its limits. Conflicting facets of sustainability compound the problem. Here we describe how reductions in the use of water in rice fields is compromising the persistence of the largest known breeding population of the Australasian Bittern (Botaurus poiciloptilus), a globally endangered waterbird. In fields with traditional, early permanent water, bitterns began nesting around 77 days after inundation, with 65\% of nests having sufficient time for all chicks to fledge before harvest. Our breeding success model showed that all nests could potentially be successful if permanent water was applied by early November, with a ponding period -- the phase when fields are flooded -- of at least 149 days. The modelling suggests that successful bittern breeding was unlikely where rice was grown using new water-saving methods -- drill-sown and delayed permanent water -- because the ponding period is too short. These methods have become the rice industry standard in Australia, rising from 34\% of fields in 2014~to 91\% in 2020. While this saved 1.5--4.5 megalitres/ha per year, it has undermined the habitat value of these agricultural wetlands. `Bittern-friendly' rice growing incentives could encourage timely nesting and maximise breeding success. Early and sufficient ponding can be complemented by establishing adjacent wetland habitat refuges, maintaining grassy banks, and creating dedicated patches to fast-track nesting. Increasing water-use efficiency in agro-ecosystems is widely touted as being beneficial to the environment, but our research demonstrates the urgent need to manage trade-offs with biodiversity conservation.},

  abstract = {Background: Coarse woody debris (CWD) is very important for forest ecosystems, particularly for biodiversity and carbon storage. Its relevance as a possible reservoir and source of nutrients is less clear, especially in central Europe. Methods: Based on a chronosequence of known ages of logs, we analyzed the nutrients stored in CWD of Fagus sylvatica, Picea abies, and Pinus sylvestris at different sites in Germany. To quantify nutrient concentrations, we assessed the use of Near Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy (NIRS) to determine the chemical properties of CWD. Results: NIRS models were suitable to predict concentrations of C, N, P, lignin and extractives. Concentrations of most nutrients increased with mass loss, with the exception of potassium, which decreased for beech and pine and remained relatively constant for spruce. The highest nutrient concentrations (N, P, S, Ca and Mn, except Mg and K) were generally observed in highly decomposed spruce logs. The net effect of decreasing CWD mass and increasing nutrient concentrations was either a decreasing (N, P and K in beech; P, Mg, K and Mn in pine), constant (S, Ca and Mg in beech; N, S and Ca in pine) or increasing amount of nutrients (N, P, S and Ca in spruce; Mn in beech) in the logs over the course of decomposition. The C/N ratio decreased for all tree species, most markedly for spruce from ca. 1000 at the beginning of the decomposition process to 180 at 36 years. The N/P ratio converged to a value of about 30 for all three species. Lignin concentrations increased for spruce and beech and remained constant for pine. Conclusions: Our results indicate that most nutrients remain in CWD for long periods. Nutrients may be used and cycled by microorganisms within CWD, but with the exception of P (in beech), Mg (in pine) and K (in beech and pine), there appears to be little net nutrient export until two thirds of the mass is lost. Instead, N, P, S and Ca were accumulated in spruce logs, indicating that CWD became a net sink rather than a net source of some nutrients for several decades.},

We analysed alpha and beta diversity in bulk soil and on plant roots, in plots cultivated with two different rice cultivars. The strongest difference was found between soil and root communities. Beside others, the anaerobic methanotroph Methanoperedens was abundant in soil, however, we detected a considerable number of ANME-2a-2b on plant roots. Furthermore, root communities were significantly affected by the water management: Differential abundance analysis revealed the enrichment of aerobic and potentially plant-growth-promoting bacteria under AWD treatment, such as Sphingomonadaceae and Rhizobiaceae (both Alphaproteobacteria), and Bacteroidetes families. Microorganisms with an overall anaerobic lifestyle, such as various Delta- A nd Epsilonproteobacteria, and Firmicutes were depleted. Our study indicates that the bulk soil communities seem overall well adapted and more resistant to changes in the water treatment, whereas the root microbiota seems more vulnerable.},

Here we use harmonized climate and land-use projections to investigate their potential combined impacts on global vertebrate diversity under a low- and a high-level emission scenario. We combine climate-based species distribution models for the world's amphibians, birds, and mammals with land-use change simulations and identify areas threatened by both climate and land-use change in the future. The combined projected effects of climate and land-use change on vertebrate diversity are similar under the two scenarios, with land-use change effects being stronger under the low- and climate change effects under the high-emission scenario. Under the low-emission scenario, increases in bioenergy cropland may cause severe impacts in biodiversity that are not compensated by lower climate change impacts. Under this low-emission scenario, larger proportions of species distributions and a higher number of small-range species may become impacted by the combination of land-use and climate change than under the high-emission scenario, largely a result of bioenergy cropland expansion. Our findings highlight the need to carefully consider both climate and land-use change when projecting biodiversity impacts. We show that biodiversity is likely to suffer severely if bioenergy cropland expansion remains a major component of climate change mitigation strategies. Our study calls for an immediate and significant reduction in energy consumption for the benefit of both biodiversity and to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.},

While this topic is receiving growing attention in politics and research, the concept continues to lack implementation partly due to varying conceptualizations and assessments of multifunctionality. To analyze how multifunctionality is conceptualized, characterized and quantified in scientific publications, we reviewed 101 studies that used quantitative methods to assess landscape or ecosystem multifunctionality. On average, 7.9 {\textpm} 4.7 ecosystem functions and services were considered, covering Provisioning (19\%), Regulating (30\%), Cultural (16\%) and Supporting (35\%) service categories. The studies ranged from micro-scale experiments to global analyses. Different methods were used to aggregate multifunctionality into a single metric (e.g. the number of ecosystem functions and services above a certain threshold, the average value of ecosystem functions and services, the sum of ecosystem functions and services). The interpretation of multifunctionality and the way it is operationalized varied largely among the studies: 42 studies assessed ecological and socio-economic variables in equal shares and often integrated stakeholders (33\%). 59 studies focused on ecological variables only and did not include stakeholders except for one study (1.7\%). Based on these findings, we discuss the implications of the conceptual and methodological ambiguity within multifunctionality assessments. We present the strengths and limitations of current approaches and provide recommendations for future multifunctionality assessments.},

  abstract = {Wetlands have been intricately linked with humankind throughout the ages. Evidence of rice culture dates to the earliest age of humans, long before the era of historical records. Drain-field and raised-field agriculture occurred in wetlands throughout large areas of Mesoamerica before Hispanic exploration of the region. About 40\% of the world's population uses rice as a major staple; rice culture currently occupies about 15\% of the world's wetland area. Wetlands are valued for high biological productivity; as filters, sinks, and transformers for sediments, nutrients, and pollutants; and as buffers between aquatic systems and human activities on upland areas. Because of their varied ecological functions, wetlands are of interest to ecotoxicologists as potential sites for detoxifying pollutants. Estimates are that wetlands occupy about 3 to 6\% of the world's land area. Attempts to define, delineate, monitor, and regulate the use of wetlands in the United States have proven to be extremely complex. Considerable progress has been made in classifying and monitoring changes in wetland areas on a nationwide basis, but less success has been achieved in defining and delineating wetlands. The United States experience should be a useful model for developingcountries to study as they attempt to deal with wetland management and protection. As long as the world's population continues to grow at exponential rates, it seems highly probable that pressure to use wetlands to meet society's demands will increase. Consequently, opportunities to set aside reserves will decrease, and the role that wetlands play in maintaining quality of life will depend more and more on our collective ability to develop and promote compatible uses on wetlands.},

  abstract = {Humans are altering the composition of biological communities through a variety of activities that increase rates of species invasions and species extinctions, at all scales, from local to global. These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem properties, how ecological communities are structured, and the forces driving species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain of the following conclusions: 1)Species' functional characteristics strongly influence ecosystem properties. Functional characteristics operate in a variety of contexts, including effects of dominant species, keystone species', ecological engineers, and interactions among species (e.g., competition, facilitation, mutualism, disease, and predation). Relative abundance alone is not always a good predictor of the ecosystem-level importance of a species, as even relatively rare species (e.g., a keystone predator) can strongly influence pathways of energy and material flows. 2) Alteration of biota in ecosystems via species invasions and extinctions caused by human activities has altered ecosystem goods and services in many well-documented cases. Many of these changes are difficult, expensive, or impossible to reverse or fix with technological solutions. 3) The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and pathways of potential community change. 4) Some ecosystem properties are initially insensitive to species loss because (a) ecosystems may have multiple species that carry out similar functional roles, (b) some species may contribute relatively little to ecosystem properties, or (c) properties may be primarily controlled by abiotic environmental conditions. 5) More species are needed to insure a stable supply of ecosystem goods and services as spatial and temporal variability increases, which typically occurs as longer time periods and larger areas are considered. We have high confidence in the following conclusions: 1) Certain combinations of species are complementary in their patterns of resource use and can increase average rates of productivity and nutrient retention. At the same time, environmental conditions can influence the importance of complementarity in structuring communities. Identification of which and how many species act in a complementary way in complex communities is just beginning. 2) Susceptibility to invasion by exotic species is strongly influenced by species composition and, under similar environmental conditions, generally decreases with increasing species richness. However, several other factors, such as propagule pressure, disturbance regime, and resource availability also strongly influence invasion success and often override effects of species richness in comparisons across different sites or ecosystems. 3) Having a range of species that respond differently to different environmental perturbations can stabilize ecosystem process rates in response to disturbances and variation in abiotic conditions. Using practices that maintain a diversity of organisms of different functional effect and functional response types will help preserve a range of management options. Uncertainties remain and further research is necessary in the following areas: 1) Further resolution of the relationships among taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, and community structure is important for identifying mechanisms of biodiversity effects. 2) Multiple trophic levels are common to ecosystems but have been understudied in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning research. The response of ecosystem properties to varying composition and diversity of consumer organisms is much more complex than responses seen in experiments that vary only the diversity of primary producers. 3) Theoretical work on stability has outpaced experimental, work, especially field research. We need long-term experiments to be able to assess temporal stability, as well as experimental perturbations to assess response to and recovery from a variety of disturbances. Design and analysis of such experiments must account for several factors that covary with species diversity. 4) Because biodiversity both responds to and influences ecosystem properties, understanding the feedbacks involved is necessary to integrate results from experimental communities with patterns seen at broader scales. Likely patterns of extinction and invasion need to be linked to different drivers of global change, the forces that structure communities, and controls on ecosystem properties for the development of effective management and conservation strategies. 5) This paper focuses primarily on terrestrial systems, with some coverage of freshwater systems, because that is where most empirical and theoretical study has focused. While the fundamental principles described here should apply to marine systems, further study of that realm is necessary. Despite some uncertainties about the mechanisms and circumstances under which diversity influences ecosystem properties, incorporating diversity effects into policy and management is essential, especially in making decisions involving large temporal and spatial scales. Sacrificing those aspects of ecosystems that are difficult or impossible to reconstruct, such as diversity, simply because we are not yet certain about the extent and mechanisms by which they affect ecosystem properties, will restrict future management options even further. It is incumbent upon ecologists to communicate this need, and the values that can derive from such a perspective, to those charged with economic and policy decision-making.},

  abstract = {Water management is one of the most important practices that affect methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from paddy fields. A field experiment was designed to study the effects of controlled irrigation (CI) on CH4 and N2O emissions from paddy fields, with traditional irrigation (TI) as the control. The effects of CI on CH4 and N2O emissions from paddy fields were very clear. The peaks of CH4 emissions from the CI paddies were observed 1-2d after the water layer disappeared. Afterward, the emissions reduced rapidly and remained low until the soil was re-flooded. A slight increase of CH4 emission was observed in a short period after re-flooding. N2O emissions peaks from CI paddies were all observed 8-10d after the fertilization at the WFPS ranging from 78.1\% to 85.3\%. Soil drying caused substantial N2O emissions, whereas no substantial N2O emissions were observed when the soil was re-wetted after the dry phase. Compared with TI, the cumulative CH4 emissions from the CI fields were reduced by 81.8\% on the average, whereas the cumulative N2O emissions were increased by 135.4\% on the average. The integrative global warming potential of CH4 and N2O on a 100-year horizon decreased by 27.3\% in the CI paddy fields, whereas no significant difference in the rice yield was observed between the CI and TI fields. These results suggest that CI can effectively mitigate the integrative greenhouse effect caused by CH4 and N2O emissions from paddy fields while ensuring the rice yield. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Rice feeds more than 50\% of the global population with significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Non-continuous flooding (NCF) has been recognized as an effective practice for stabilizing rice yields, conserving water, and reducing GHG emissions from rice fields. However, the impacts of NCF on net carbon sequestration (NCS, defined as the total ecosystem GHG equivalent) in rice fields, including CH4 emissions, N2O emissions, photosynthetic carbon sequestration linked to crop yield, and soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration, have rarely been quantified comprehensively. This limitation hinders a complete understanding of the overall processes through which NCF affects NCS. This study conducted a meta-analysis of 1075 data pairs from 72 studies worldwide to quantify the effects of NCF on GHG equivalent components and its overall NCS benefits. Results showed that compared to continuous flooding (CF), NCF significantly increased the average NCS per growing season by 4615 kg CO2-eq{$\cdot$}ha-1 (95\% CIs: 468 to 8761, p = 0.031). Specifically, NCF significantly reduced CH4 emissions by 45.72\% and significantly increased N2O emissions by 35.77\%, with an insignificant increase of 1.93\% and 3.16\% in CO2 emissions and yield, respectively. The {$\Delta$}SOC (changes of SOC concentration before and after the growing season) significantly decreased with the mean difference effect size of -0.36 (95\% CIs: -0.70 to -0.02), indicating smaller SOC changes for NCF. Meta-regression and random forest importance analyses were used to explore the effects of climatic and soil properties and management practices on GHG equivalent components. Implementing controlled irrigation with appropriate limitation of total water input could achieve a win-win situation of enhancing rice yield while mitigating GWP and Y-GWP. This study further quantified the effects of NCF on all components of GHG equivalent and the NCS benefits in rice fields, providing guidance for irrigation management practices to achieve dual carbon goals.},

For each diversity measure, iNEXT uses the observed sample of abundance or incidence data (called the "reference sample") to compute diversity estimates and the associated 95\% confidence intervals for the following two types of rarefaction and extrapolation (R/E): 1. Sample-size-based R/E sampling curves: iNEXT computes diversity estimates for rarefied and extrapolated samples up to an appropriate size. This type of sampling curve plots the diversity estimates with respect to sample size. 2. Coverage-based R/E sampling curves: iNEXT computes diversity estimates for rarefied and extrapolated samples with sample completeness (as measured by sample coverage) up to an appropriate coverage. This type of sampling curve plots the diversity estimates with respect to sample coverage. iNEXT also plots the above two types of sampling curves and a sample completeness curve. The sample completeness curve provides a bridge between these two types of curves.

  abstract = {Drying-wetting cycles are important environmental factors controlling potential changes in aggregate stability. However, the relationships between soil aggregate stability and drying-wetting cycles under different breakdown mechanisms are not clear. We conducted a simulation study to investigate the effects of drying-wetting cycles on aggregate stability under the three main breakdown mechanisms (slaking, microcracking, and mechanical breakdown) without soil organic matter inputs. Four initial aggregate size classes (i.e., 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 5, and 5 to 7 mm) within a clay-loam soil, which undergoes intense drying-wetting cycles, were selected and subjected to eight levels of drying-wetting cycles (i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15 cycles). Aggregate stability was measured with three treatment methods involving fast wetting (FW), slow wetting (SW), and shaking after prewetting treatments (ST). Our study showed higher resistance to mechanical breakdown and lower resistance to slaking. Compared with the mean weight diameter (MWD), the normalized mean weight diameter (NMWD) was a better indicator of comparing the susceptibility of different initial size aggregates to breaking up into smaller aggregates.The values of NMWD for 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 5, and 5 to 7 mm aggregates were 0.1, 0.1, 0.09, and 0.09, respectively, for FW; 0.35, 0.34, 0.33, and 0.32, respectively, for SW; and 0.46, 0.45, 0.44, and 0.42, respectively, for ST.This indicated that as initial aggregate size increased, aggregates were more prone to breaking down. The effects of drying-wetting cycles on aggregate stability varied greatly among different aggregate breakdown mechanisms. For 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 5, and 5 to 7 mm size aggregates, drying-wetting cycles decreased MWD by 61\%, 67\%, 70\%, and 53\%, respectively, for SW, and 69\%, 72\%, 80\%, and 78\%, respectively, for ST. For FW, MWD increased by 5\%, 7\%, 8\%, and 36\% after the first two cycles, respectively, while it decreased by 36\%, 36\%, 44\%, and 15\% after 15 cycles.The results showed that different aggregate breakdown mechanisms influence the effects of drying-wetting cycles on aggregate stability.This study provides an important basis for better soil management practices and yields insights for an improved understanding of the role of drying-wetting cycles on aggregate stability.},

Here, we relate plant and microbial diversity to soil multifunctionality across 130 dryland sites along a 4,000 km aridity gradient in northern China. Our results show a strong positive association between plant species richness and soil multifunctionality in less arid regions, whereas microbial diversity, in particular of fungi, is positively associated with multifunctionality in more arid regions. This shift in the relationships between plant or microbial diversity and soil multifunctionality occur at an aridity level of {$\sim$}0.8, the boundary between semiarid and arid climates, which is predicted to advance geographically {$\sim$}28\% by the end of the current century.

This paper is to provide information regarding the potential magnitude and monetary value of seven functions of paddy fields in Taiwan, including flood mitigation, fostering water resources, preventing soil erosion, purifying water, cooling air temperature, refreshing atmosphere and recreation. For quantification of the above values, replacement cost method (RCM), contingent valuation method (CVM), and the travel cost method (TCM) are adopted. In addition, the ratio of monetary value and their rice production commodity value (R) was also estimated. The results indicated that the flood mitigation function had a monetary value of US\vphantom\{\} 389 million each year, and the ratio to the rice production value R was estimated at 37\%.

These communities have limited interaction and exchange, and each group faces research challenges according to independently operating paradigms. This paper presents a comparative review of published research in multifunctional agriculture and ecosystem services. The motivation for this work is to improve communication, integrate experimental approaches, and propose areas of consensus and dialog for the two communities. This extensive analysis of publication trends, ideologies, and approaches enables formulation of four main conclusions. First, the two communities are closely related through their use of the term ``function.'' However, multifunctional agriculture considers functions as agricultural activity outputs and prefers farm-centred approaches, whereas ecosystem services considers ecosystem functions in the provision of services and prefers service-centred approaches. Second, research approaches to common questions in these two communities share some similarities, and there would be great value in integrating these approaches. Third, the two communities have potential for dialog regarding the bundle of ecosystem services and the spectrum of multifunctional agriculture, or regarding land sharing and land sparing. Fourth, we propose an integrated conceptual framework that distinguishes six groups of ecosystem services and disservices in the agricultural landscape, and combines the concepts of multifunctional agriculture and ecosystem services. This integrated framework improves applications of multifunctional agriculture and ecosystem services for operational use. Future research should examine if the framework can be readily adapted for modelling specific problems in agricultural management.},

Previous studies on CWD have focused on the input, decomposition, reserve dynamics, and CWD functions, but coarse woody debris decomposition is complex and the results from different regions vary considerably. It is not clear which factors affect decay rate (               k               ), especially at different decomposition stages. In this study, a single-exponential decay model was used to analyze the characteristics of CWD decomposition in               Larix gmelinii               forests over the 33~years following a fire in the Greater Khingan Mountains. The results show that the decay rate of coarse woody debris was positively correlated to decay class. The average decomposition rate was 0.019, and 41~years and 176~years are needed for a 50\% and 95\% mass loss, respectively. CWD nutrient content, density, and water content could explain the variance in the decay rate ({\textasciitilde}\,42\%) of the decay factors such as amount of leaching, degree of fragmentation, respiration of the debris, and biotransformation, and varied significantly between different decay classes. Using the space--time substitution method, this study arranged the coarse woody debris of different mortality times to form a 33~year chronosequence which revealed the decomposition process. It was concluded that the decay rate was mainly explained by structural component of the debris and its nitrogen and water contents. This paper quantifies the indicators affecting CWD decay to explain the decomposition process.},

  abstract = {Methane is an important greenhouse gas, which contributes approximately 20\% to global warming. The atmospheric CH 4 concentration is increasing rapidly, resulting from an imbalance between CH 4 production and consumption. The only known biological CH 4 sinks are soils where methanotrophic bacteria consume CH 4 by oxidizing it. For several reasons the CH 4 uptake potential, particularly of arable soils and grassland, is only partly exploited, as several agricultural practices have adverse impacts on the activity of the CH 4 oxidizing bacteria. The kind of land use in general has a remarkable influence with much higher oxidation rates under forest than under grassland or arable soil. Regular soil cultivation by ploughing and fertilization with ammonium or urea have been identified as main factors. Immediately after ammonium application the methanotrophic enzyme system is blocked, resulting in an inhibition of CH 4 oxidation. In addition to this short-term effect a long-term effect exists after repeated ammonium fertilization, which is most likely caused by a shift in the population of soil microbes. Crop residues affect CH 4 oxidation differently, depending on their C/N ratio: with a wide C/N ratio no effects are expected, whereas with a narrow C/N ratio strong inhibition was observed. Animal manure, particularly slurry, can cause CH 4 emission immediately after application, whereas in the long run farmyard manure does not seem to have adverse impacts on CH 4 oxidation. The methanotrophic activity decreased markedly with soil pH, although in many cases liming of acidified soils did not show a positive effect. Arable soils have a rather small pH range which allows CH 4 oxidation, and the inhibitory effect of ammonium can partly result from a concomitant decrease in soil pH. Reduced tillage was identified as a measure to improve the methanotrophic activity of arable land, set aside of formerly ploughed soil points into the same direction. Plant growth itself is not primarily responsible for observed effects on CH 4 oxidation, but secondary factors like differential pesticide treatments, changes in pH, or cultivation effects are more likely involved. Although for the overall CH 4 fluxes the oxidation processes in agricultural soils are of minor importance, all available possibilities should be exhausted to improve or at least preserve their ability to oxidize CH 4 .},

Rice, the staple food of more than half of the world's population, is the most prominent cause of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in agriculture and gives way to global warming. The increasing demand for rice in the future has deployed tremendous concerns to reduce GHG emissions for minimizing the negative environmental impacts of rice cultivation. In this review, we presented a contemporary synthesis of existing data on how crop management practices influence emissions of GHGs in rice fields. We realized that modifications in traditional crop management regimes possess a huge potential to overcome GHG emissions. We examined and evaluated the different possible options and found that modifying tillage permutations and irrigation patterns, managing organic and fertilizer inputs, selecting suitable cultivar, and cropping regime can mitigate GHG emissions. Previously, many authors have discussed the feasibility principle and the influence of these practices on a single gas or, in particular, in the whole agricultural sector. Nonetheless, changes in management practices may influence more than one gas at the same time by different mechanisms or sometimes their effects may be antagonistic. Therefore, in the present attempt, we estimated the overall global warming potential of each approach to consider the magnitude of its effects on all gases and provided a comprehensive assessment of suitable crop management practices for reducing GHG emissions in rice culture.},

  abstract = {International efforts to mitigate human-caused changes in the Earth's climate are considering a system of incentives (debits and credits) that would encourage specific changes in land use that can help to reduce the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide. The two primary land-based activities that would help to minimize atmospheric carbon dioxide are carbon storage in the terrestrial biosphere and the efficient substitution of biomass fuels and bio-based products for fossil fuels and energy-intensive products. These two activities have very different land requirements and different implications for the preservation of biodiversity and the maintenance of other ecosystem services. Carbon sequestration in living forests can be pursued on lands with low productivity, i.e. on lands that are least suitable for agriculture or intensive forestry, and are compatible with the preservation of biodiversity over large areas. In contrast, intensive harvest-and-use systems for biomass fuels and products generally need more productive land to be economically viable. Intensive harvest-and-use systems may compete with agriculture or they may shift intensive land uses onto the less productive lands that currently harbor most of the Earth's biodiversity. Win-win solutions for carbon dioxide control and biodiversity are possible, but careful evaluation and planning are needed to avoid practices that reduce biodiversity with little net decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Planning is more complex on a politically subdivided Earth where issues of local interest, national sovereignty, and equity come into play. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  abstract = {Methane is an important greenhouse gas, which contributes approximately 20\% to global warming. The atmospheric CH4 concentration is increasing rapidly, resulting from an imbalance between CH4 production and consumption. The only known biological CH4 sinks are soils where methanotrophic bacteria consume CH4 by oxidizing it. For several reasons the CH4 uptake potential, particularly of arable soils and grassland, is only partly exploited, as several agricultural practices have adverse impacts on the activity of the CH4 oxidizing bacteria. The kind of land use in general has a remarkable influence with much higher oxidation rates under forest than under grassland or arable soil. Regular soil cultivation by ploughing and fertilization with ammonium or urea have been identified as main factors. Immediately after ammonium application the methanotrophic enzyme system is blocked, resulting in an inhibition of CH4 oxidation. In addition to this short-term effect a long-term effect exists after repeated ammonium fertilization, which is most likely caused by a shift in the population of soil microbes. Crop residues affect CH4 oxidation differently, depending on their C/N ratio: with a wide C/N ratio no effects are expected, whereas with a narrow C/N ratio strong inhibition was observed. Animal manure, particularly slurry, can cause CH4 emission immediately after application, whereas in the long run farmyard manure does not seem to have adverse impacts on CH4 oxidation. The methanotrophic activity decreased markedly with soil pH, although in many cases liming of acidified soils did not show a positive effect. Arable soils have a rather small pH range which allows CH4 oxidation, and the inhibitory effect of ammonium can partly result from a concomitant decrease in soil pH. Reduced tillage was identified as a measure to improve the methanotrophic activity of arable land, set aside of formerly ploughed soil points into the same direction. Plant growth itself is not primarily responsible for observed effects on CH4 oxidation, but secondary factors like differential pesticide treatments, changes in pH, or cultivation effects are more likely involved. Although for the overall CH4 fluxes the oxidation processes in agricultural soils are of minor importance, all available possibilities should be exhausted to improve or at least preserve their ability to oxidize CH4. {\copyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Most literature on birds and rice (Oryza sativa) focuses on the non-growing period and little is known about the influence of management practices during cultivation. A review found that the main factors affecting species composition and abundance in rice fields during the growing season were water level, flooding period, rice plant structure and size, and pesticide use. Highest bird density and diversity occurred at intermediate water levels (1020 cm). Early flooding and late drying favored waterbird density and diversity, and the stopover of migrating species. Taller plants, at higher densities, reduced prey availability to most waterbirds but favored smaller species. Pesticides and herbicides have been shown to be toxic to birds and reduce food resources. A case study is presented for the Ebro delta, Spain. Three management schemes were compared: organic, agri-environmental and conventional. Bird density, biomass and diversity throughout the growing and non-growing seasons were determined in three consecutive years. Bird biomass, density and diversity averaged higher in the organic rice fields, but only biomass was significantly different. The higher biomass reflects the presence of a higher biomass of prey items (fish, invertebrates and macrophytes) in the organic rice fields, likely due to the lack of pesticides. Further research should focus on a quantitative assessment of the effects of specific management practices.},

This review describes the relationships between methylotrophs and plants, and between methanotrophs (methane-utilizers, a subset of methylotrophs) and heterotrophic bacteria. Some plants emit methane and methanol from their leaves, and provide methylotrophs with habitats. Methanol-utilizing methylotrophs in the genus Methylobacterium are abundant in the phyllosphere and have the ability to promote the growth of some plants. Methanotrophs also inhabit the phyllosphere, and methanotrophs with high methane oxidation activities have been found on aquatic plants. Both plant and environmental factors are involved in shaping the methylotroph community on plants. Methanotrophic activity can be enhanced by heterotrophic bacteria that provide growth factors (e.g., cobalamin). Information regarding the biological interaction of methylotrophs with other organisms will facilitate a better understanding of the carbon cycle that is driven by methylotrophs.},

Fine woody debris (FWD; 0.6--29.9 cm), coarse woody debris (CWD; {$\geq$}30.0 cm), and snags ({$\geq$}5 cm) were inventoried and mapped in eighteen 4 ha plots before and after applying thinning (overstory, understory, and no thinning) and burning (burn and no burn) treatments. The combination of burning and thinning reduced FWD and CWD quantity and mean piece size, removed highly decayed logs, and increased small (5.0--24.9 cm) snag recruitment. In contrast, thin-only treatments produced similar results but increased FWD and did not remove many small snags. There were no differences in DWM response between the two thinning treatments. Log and snag spatial patterns prior to and following treatment were similar. These results indicate that burning in combination with thinning is more effective at reducing surface FWD and CWD, and removing small trees than are burn-only and thin-only treatments. Although large snags and logs were consumed in the burn, long-term recruitment of these habitat structures relies on managers retaining large-diameter trees. Repeated burns need to be conducted after initial restoration treatments to understand natural patterns of DWM.},

  abstract = {This Synthesis Report (SYR) of the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) summarises the state of knowledge of climate change, its widespread impacts and risks, and climate change mitigation and adaptation, based on the peer-reviewed scientific, technical and socio-economic literature since the publication of the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) in 2014. The assessment is undertaken within the context of the evolving international landscape, in particular, developments in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process, including the outcomes of the Kyoto Protocol and the adoption of the Paris Agreement. It reflects the increasing diversity of those involved in climate action. This report integrates the main findings of the AR6 Working Group reports58 and the three AR6 Special Reports59. It recognizes the interdependence of climate, ecosystems and biodiversity, and human societies; the value of diverse forms of knowledge; and the close linkages between climate change adaptation, mitigation, ecosystem health, human well-being and sustainable development. Building on multiple analytical frameworks, including those from the physical and social sciences, this report identifies opportunities for transformative action which are effective, feasible, just and equitable using concepts of systems transitions and resilient development pathways60. Different regional classification schemes61 are used for physical, social and economic aspects, reflecting the underlying literature. After this introduction, Section 2, `Current Status and Trends', opens with the assessment of observational evidence for our changing climate, historical and current drivers of human-induced climate change, and its impacts. It assesses the current implementation of adaptation and mitigation response options. Section 3, `Long-Term Climate and Development Futures', provides a long-term assessment of climate change to 2100 and beyond in a broad range of socio-economic 58 The three Working Group contributions to AR6 are: Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis; Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability; and Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change, respectively. Their assessments cover scientific literature accepted for publication respectively by 31 January 2021, 1 September 2021 and 11 October 2021. 59 The three Special Reports are : Global Warming of 1.5{$^\circ$}C (2018): an IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5{$^\circ$}C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty (SR1.5); Climate Change and Land (2019): an IPCC Special Report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems (SRCCL); and The Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (2019) (SROCC). The Special Reports cover scientific literature accepted for publication respectively by 15 May 2018, 7 April 2019 and 15 May 2019. 60 The Glossary (Annex I) includes definitions of these, and other terms and concepts used in this report drawn from the AR6 joint Working Group Glossary. 61 Depending on the climate information context, geographical regions in AR6 may refer to larger areas, such as sub-continents and oceanic regions, or to typological regions, such as monsoon regions, coastlines, mountain ranges or cities. A new set of standard AR6 WGI reference land and ocean regions have been defined. WGIII allocates countries to geographical regions, based on the UN Statistics Division Classification \{WGI 1.4.5, WGI 10.1, WGI 11.9, WGI 12.1--12.4, WGI Atlas.1.3.3--1.3.4\}. 62 Each finding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement. A level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers: very low, low, medium, high and very high, and typeset in italics, for example, medium confidence. The following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or result: virtually certain 99--100\% probability; very likely 90--100\%; likely 66--100\%; more likely than not {\textbackslash}textgreater50-100\%; about as likely as not 33--66\%; unlikely 0--33\%; very unlikely 0--10\%; and exceptionally unlikely 0--1\%. Additional terms (extremely likely 95--100\% and extremely unlikely 0--5\%) are also used when appropriate. Assessed likelihood also is typeset in italics: for example, very likely. This is consistent with AR5. In this Report, unless stated otherwise, square brackets [x to y] are used to provide the assessed very likely range, or 90\% interval. futures. It considers long-term characteristics, impacts, risks and costs in adaptation and mitigation pathways in the context of sustainable development. Section 4, `Near- Term Responses in a Changing Climate', assesses opportunities for scaling up effective action in the period up to 2040, in the context of climate pledges, and commitments, and the pursuit of sustainable development. Based on scientific understanding, key findings can be formulated as statements of fact or associated with an assessed level of confidence using the IPCC calibrated language62.

  abstract = {Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture sector play an important role for global warming and climate change. Thus, it is necessary to find out GHG emissions mitigation strategies from rice cultivation. The efficient management of nitrogen fertilizer using urea deep placement (UDP) and the use of the water-saving alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation could mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and reduce environmental pollution. However, there is a dearth of studies on the impacts of UDP and the integrated plant nutrient system (IPNS) which combines poultry manure and prilled urea (PU) with different irrigation regimes on GHG emissions, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and rice yields. We conducted field experiments during the dry seasons of 2018, 2019, and 2020 to compare the effects of four fertilizer treatments including control (no N), PU, UDP, and IPNS in combination with two irrigation systems--- (AWD and continuous flooding, CF) on GHG emissions, NUE and rice yield. Fertilizer treatments had significant (p {$<$} 0.05) interaction effects with irrigation regimes on methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. PU reduced CH4 and N2O emissions by 6\% and 20\% compared to IPNS treatment, respectively under AWD irrigation, but produced similar emissions under CF irrigation. Similarly, UDP reduced cumulative CH4 emissions by 9\% and 15\% under AWD irrigation, and 9\% and 11\% under CF condition compared to PU and IPNS treatments, respectively. Across the year and fertilizer treatments, AWD irrigation significantly (p {$<$} 0.05) reduced cumulative CH4 emissions and GHG intensity by 28\%, and 26\%, respectively without significant yield loss compared to CF condition. Although AWD irrigation increased cumulative N2O emissions by 73\%, it reduced the total global warming potential by 27\% compared to CF irrigation. The CH4 emission factor for AWD was lower (1.67 kg ha 1 day 1) compared to CF (2.33 kg ha 1 day 1). Across the irrigation regimes, UDP increased rice yield by 21\% and N recovery efficiency by 58\% compared to PU. These results suggest that both UDP and AWD irrigation might be considered as a carbon-friendly technology.},

By repeatedly wetting and drying the soil under AWD, accentuated pore structure of the rhizosphere compared to flooded rice may occur. This could affect root growth and resource capture, but to date the physical structure and behaviour of the rhizosphere of rice under AWD has not been explored. In a controlled glasshouse experiment, two different textured soils were used in split rhizotrunks to separate a root-zone from bulk soil using mesh. To mimic a paddy field, the top of the rhizotrunk was filled with puddled soil and below the puddled layer there was a sieved soil layer. Root-zone physical properties were measured using a combination of high resolution X-ray CT imaging (pore structure), a miniaturised infiltrometer (hydrological) and a small indenter (mechanical). Soil under AWD irrigation had 46\% greater macroporosity and 20\% more pore connectivity compared to continuous flooding (CF). Compared to the bulk soil, root-zone soil under AWD or CF had greater macroporosity, water sorptivity and mechanical hardness. In the root-zone, AWD compared to CF increased the rate of water absorption by around 36\%, but did not affect mechanical hardness. Our results suggest AWD interacting with rice roots could promote more effective water transmission through a more stable, larger and better-connected pore system. The results of this study also suggest that soil physical changes by AWD could improve the utilization of resources in a rice production system.},

The objectives of this study were to investigate (i) whether soil microbial communities track the changes in aboveground vegetation during succession; and (ii) whether microbial communities return to their native state over time. Two successional gradients with different vegetation were studied at the W. K. Kellogg Biological Station, Michigan. The first gradient comprised a conventionally tilled cropland (CT), mid-succession forest (SF) abandoned from cultivation prior to 1951, and native deciduous forest (DF). The second gradient comprised the CT cropland, early-succession grassland (ES) restored in 1989, and long-term mowed grassland (MG). With succession, the total microbial PLFAs and soil microbial biomass C consistently increased in both gradients. While bacterial rRNA gene diversity remained unchanged, the abundance and composition of many bacterial phyla changed significantly. Moreover, microbial communities in the relatively pristine DF and MG soils were very similar despite major differences in soil properties and vegetation. After {\textbackslash}textgreater50 years of succession, and despite different vegetation, microbial communities in SF were more similar to those in mature DF than in CT. In contrast, even after 17 years of succession, microbial communities in ES were more similar to CT than endpoint MG despite very different vegetation between CT and ES. This result suggested a lasting impact of cultivation history on the soil microbial community. With conversion of deciduous to conifer forest (CF), there was a significant change in multiple soil properties that correlated with changes in microbial biomass, rRNA gene diversity and community composition. In conclusion, history of land-use was a stronger determinant of the composition of microbial communities than vegetation and soil properties. Further, microbial communities in disturbed soils apparently return to their native state with time. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Rice is a main staple food for roughly half of the world's population, but rice agriculture is also a main source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Many studies have reported that water management (e.g. alternate wetting and drying, intermittent irrigation, mid-season drain, aerobic rice) affects rice yields and methane (CH 4 ) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from rice paddies. However, these studies span a variety of practices and vary in experimental design and results, making it difficult to determine their global response from individual experiments. Here we conducted a meta-analysis using 201 paired observations from 52 studies to assess the effects of water management practices on GHG emissions and rice yield. Overall, compared to continuous flooding, non-continuous flooding practices reduced CH 4 emissions by 53\%, increased N 2 O emissions by 105\%, and decreased yield by 3.6\%. Importantly, N 2 O emissions were low, contributing, on average, 12\% to the combined global warming potential (GWP; CH 4 + N 2 O). As a result, non-continuous flooding reduced GWP (-44\%) and yield-scaled GWP (-42\%). However, non-continuous flooding practices stimulated N 2 O emissions to a greater degree in soils with high organic carbon or with manure additions. The reduction in CH 4 emissions increased with the number of drying events, soil drying severity, and the number of unflooded days. Currently, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scaling factors for single and multiple ({$\geq$} 2) drying events are 0.6 and 0.52. Based on this analysis using actual side-by- side field studies, we suggest changing these to 0.67 for a single event and 0.36 for multiple events.},

Soil Eh and four related bacterial groups were also measured to clarify their effects on gaseous emissions. Three ranges of soil redox potential were related to gas emissions: below -100 mV with vigorous CH4 emission, above +100 mV with significant N2 O emission, and +100 to -100 mV with little CH4 and N2 O emissions. Intermittently draining the field increased soil oxidation, with a decrease in CH4 emission and an increase in N2 O emission. In general the mid-season drainage slightly increased the populations of methanotrophs, nitrifiers, and denitrifiers but decreased that of methanogens.

The relationships were influenced by the types of organisms that soil phylotypes with larger sizes or at higher trophic levels, for example, invertebrates or protist predators, appeared to exhibit weaker or no BEF relationships when compared to those with smaller sizes or at lower trophic levels, for example, archaea, bacteria, fungi, and protist phototrophs. Particularly, we highlighted the role of soil network complexity, reflected by co-occurrence patterns among multitrophic-level organisms, in enhancing the link between soil biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Our results represent a significant advance in forecasting the impacts of belowground multitrophic organisms on ecosystem functions in agricultural systems, and suggest that soil multitrophic network complexity should be considered a key factor in enhancing ecosystem productivity and sustainability under land-use intensification.},

Data were collected from 29 patches ranging in size from 0.3 to 28 ha. A total of 897 dead trees with a minimum diameter of {\textbackslash}textgreater 15 cm occurred on the 7.2 ha area analysed. The year of death was established for 50 \% of these trees. CWD volume ranged from 17 to 65 m3/ha for downed logs and from 0.5 to 13 m3/ha for standing snags. CWD of all decay stages and diameter classes occurred abundantly and the probability of finding logs of all decay stages and sizes was very high at the scale of single hectares. Tree mortality differed among 5 yr periods. However, during the last 50 yr no 5 yr period produced less than 3 logs/ha. Decay rates were highly variable among different logs. Logs with soft wood and some wood pieces lost (decay stage 5) died ca. 34 years ago. This suggests a fairly rapid decay in this northern forest. The data indicate a high and continuous availability of CWD of all types. It is likely, therefore, that selection pressures for efficient dispersal among CWD dependent species may not be very high. Consequently, species with narrow habitat demands and/or low dispersal ability may have evolved and this may contribute to the decrease of certain species in the managed landscape.},

Drill resistance measurements are introduced as a approach to estimate the density of CWD in different stages of decay. Dead logs of Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst.] from a Central European mountainous site were used as a test system to compare the new method with conventional predictors of wood density such as fast quantitative field estimates (e.g., knife probe) and classification of decay classes based on a set of qualitative traits and quantitative estimates. The model containing only drill resistance as a predictor explained 65\% of the variation in wood density and was markedly better than models containing one or more of several conventional predictors. However, we show that the relationship between drill resistance and gravimetric wood density relationship is sensitive to the decay status. Therefore, the best model combines drill resistance and decay class (adj. R2 = 0.732). An additional experiment showed that drill resistance is also sensitive to the moisture state (fresh vs. oven-dry) of the sample. The major potential of the method lies in its non-destructive nature which allows repeated sampling in long-term ecosystem studies or in protected areas where destructive sampling is prohibited. The limitations of the method are discussed and recommendations for applications are given. {\copyright} The Author(s) 2009.},

Despite this, knowledge of the effects of organic farming systems on farmland biodiversity is limited in Asia, the worldwide leader in rice production. We conducted the first national-scale study to investigate the effects of three different rice farming systems (conventional, low-input and organic) and specific management practices (e.g. herbicide and insecticide applications, crop rotation and levee-vegetation management) on species richness and abundance of multiple taxonomic groups (plants, invertebrates, Pelophylax and Hyla japonica frogs, cobitid loaches and birds) in Japan during 2013--2015. Organic fields supported the highest richness and abundance of several taxonomic groups (native/Red List plants, Tetragnatha spiders, Sympetrum dragonflies and Pelophylax frogs), followed by low-input and conventional fields. We also found taxon-specific responses to specific management practices. For instance, plant richness and Tetragnatha and Sympetrum abundance increased with reduced herbicide and/or insecticide applications. Sympetrum and cobitid loach abundance increased in the absence of crop rotation, whereas H. japonica abundance increased with crop rotation. Pelophylax abundance increased with an increased height of levee vegetation. At spatial scales larger than single fields, waterbird richness and abundance were positively correlated with the proportion of organic rice fields, presumably due to increased prey abundance. Meanwhile, landbird richness and abundance were positively associated with annual precipitation and annual mean temperature, suggesting that such climate increases food availability. Synthesis and applications. We highlight the positive effects of organic and low-input farming for biodiversity relative to conventional farming in rice paddies. We also provide the scientific basis of the current agri-environmental schemes in Japan, subsidising organic and low-input farming for biodiversity. The taxon-specific associations with management practices indicate that avoiding crop rotation, maintaining levee vegetation and organic farming at large spatial scales can also be wildlife friendly. These practices may thus be incorporated into agri-environment schemes for effective biodiversity conservation.},

  abstract = {Reservoir drawdown areas---where sediment is exposed to the atmosphere due to water-level fluctuations---are hotspots for carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. However, the global extent of drawdown areas is unknown, precluding an accurate assessment of the carbon budget of reservoirs. Here we show, on the basis of satellite observations of 6,794 reservoirs between 1985 and 2015, that 15\% of the global reservoir area was dry. Exposure of drawdown areas was most pronounced in reservoirs close to the tropics and shows a complex dependence on climatic (precipitation, temperature) and anthropogenic (water use) drivers. We re-assessed the global carbon emissions from reservoirs by apportioning CO2 and methane emissions to water surfaces and drawdown areas using published areal emission rates. The new estimate assigns 26.2 (15--40) (95\% confidence interval) TgCO2-C yr-1 to drawdown areas, and increases current global CO2 emissions from reservoirs by 53\% (60.3 (43.2--79.5) TgCO2-C yr-1). Taking into account drawdown areas, the ratio between carbon emissions and carbon burial in sediments is 2.02 (1.04--4.26). This suggests that reservoirs emit more carbon than they bury, challenging the current understanding that reservoirs are net carbon sinks. Thus, consideration of drawdown areas overturns our conception of the role of reservoirs in the carbon cycle.},

The relationship between the volume of live and dead trees was also examined. In both OGFs and MFs, the most snags were found in the third decay stage, while the volume of logs and stumps increased from the first to fifth decay class. The study showed the clear advantage of OGFs over adjacent selection MFs in terms of CWD volume, whereas the basal area of live trees and growing stock were not always reliable indicators for distinguishing between MFs and OGFs. The diameter distribution of individual CWD types (snags, logs, stumps) also differed significantly between selection MFs and OGFs in all tested pairs. This fact, along with the significant differences in CWD volume, indicates that selection silviculture should be amended to incorporate practices that ensure more natural management of deadwood components.},

However, it is either less implemented or adopted because it consumes more time and energy. Therefore, an experiment was conducted to determine the effective water depth that can keep soil moisture close to saturation for a commonly practiced irrigation interval, combined with a rainfall pattern for increasing water productivity. The design was a randomized complete block with three replications and four water treatments representing 120\% (T120), 180\% (T180), 240\% (T240), and 300\% (T300) of soil saturation or the application of 2, 3, 4 and 5 cm water depth. The results showed that the application of 3 cm was the effective depth. It decreased plant height, tiller number, chlorophyll content, and panicle number per hill by 12.37\%, 20.84\%, 7.59\%, and 70.98\%, respectively. The decrease of these parameters is followed by total recovery due to effective rainfall contribution, which led to low yield sacrifice (6\% of reduction) and 40\% of water saving. We argue that weekly application of a 3 cm water depth and matching crop needed-water period with the onset of rainfall may be implemented and recommended as suitable saturated soil culture practice for rice production in high water demand conditions.},

  abstract = {Tropical deforestation is estimated to cause about one-quarter of anthropogenic carbon emissions, loss of biodiversity, and other environmental services. United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change talks are now considering mechanisms for avoiding deforestation (AD), but the economic potential of AD has yet to be addressed. We use three economic models of global land use and management to analyze the potential contribution of AD activities to reduced greenhouse gas emissions. AD activities are found to be a competitive, low-cost abatement option. A program providing a 10\% reduction in deforestation from 2005 to 2030 could provide 0.3-0.6 Gt (1 Gt = 1 {\texttimes} 105 g) CO2{$\cdot$}yr-1 in emission reductions and would require \vphantom\{\}0.4 billion to \vphantom\{\}1.7 billion{$\cdot$}yr -1 for 30 years. A 50\% reduction in deforestation from 2005 to 2030 could provide 1.5-2.7 Gt CO2{$\cdot$}yr-1 in emission reductions and would require \vphantom\{\}17.2 billion to \vphantom\{\}28.0 billion{$\cdot$}yr -1. Finally, some caveats to the analysis that could increase costs of AD programs are described. {\copyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

Although IPM is becoming popular in the control of rice pests, those `minor' insects and aquatic insects that have no direct economic impact on rice production have received little attention. Consequently, some of them are in danger of extinction requiring conservation. A new concept, `Integrated biodiversity management (IBM)', is proposed under which IPM and conservation are reconciled and made compatible with each other. As an operational concept in agroecology, premises for implementing IBM are suggested.},

  abstract = {Paddy soils make up the largest anthropogenic wetlands on earth. They may originate from any type of soil in pedological terms, but are highly modified by anthropogenic activities. The formation of these Anthrosols is induced by tilling the wet soil (puddling), and the flooding and drainage regime associated with the development of a plough pan and specific redoximorphic features. Redox potential oscillations due to paddy management control microbial community structure and function and thus short-term biogeochemical processes. After flooding, microbial reduction processes sequentially use NO3-, Mn4+, Fe3+, SO42- as electron acceptors, accompanied by the emission of the trace gases N2O, N2, H2S, CH4 and - due to reduction-induced increasing pH - NH3. This results in N losses and low N fertilizer use efficiency. However, transport of atmospheric O2 to the roots via the rice plant's aerenchyma modifies conditions in the rhizosphere, leading to nitrification and methane oxidation, and precipitation of Mn and Fe oxides. High concentrations and fluxes of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in paddy soils from plant debris trigger microbial activity and thus the emission of greenhouse gases. Retention of DOM by soil minerals and its subsequent stabilisation against microbial decay depend on the redox state (e.g. DOM precipitation by Fe2+ under anaerobic conditions). Oscillation in redox conditions may enhance retention and stabilisation of DOM by Fe oxyhydroxides. Induced by the periodic short-term redox cycles, paddy management over long periods has strong effects on long-term biogeochemical processes. Frequent irrigation intensifies mineral weathering and leaching processes. High concentrations of DOM during flooding seasons enhance the changes and the release of structural iron in clay minerals, and support the formation of ferrihydrite. Repeated redox alternations lead to a translocation of iron in various directions, and particularly increase the crystallinity of iron oxides. This results also in higher total iron oxide contents in paddy compared to non-paddy soils. The large accumulation of soil organic matter (SOM) observed in some, but not all paddy soils, is considered to be due to high input of plant residues and charred material associated with retarded decomposition under anaerobic conditions. There is also evidence of SOM stabilisation via occlusion into aggregates and phytoliths as well as interactions with clay minerals and iron oxides. SOM accumulation in paddy subsoils can be explained by downward movement of DOM and its stabilisation by interaction with iron oxides. A specific feature of paddy soils is the coupling of organic matter turnover with mineral transformations and fluxes, which seem to be intensified by the alternating redox conditions with increasing age of paddy soil development. Bioavailability of soil organic N is strongly coupled to SOM cycling and is a crucial parameter determining crop yield. Anaerobic conditions inhibit N mineralization, with a high risk of gaseous N losses. In paddy soils the management-induced, microbially mediated redox processes control the dynamics of soil minerals and soil organic matter, which are strongly related to the microbial accessibility of C and N, but also of Fe. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Volume or biomass estimates of downed woody debris are crucial for numerous applications such as forest carbon stock assessment, biodiversity assessments, and more recently for environmental evaluations of biofuel harvesting practices. Both fixed-area sampling (FAS) and line-intersect sampling (LIS) are used in forest inventories and ecological studies because they are unbiased and accurate methods. Nevertheless, most studies and inventories take into account only coarse woody debris (CWD, {$>$}10 cm in diameter), although fine woody debris (FWD) can account for a large part of the total downed biomass. We compared the LIS and FAS methods for FWD volume or biomass estimates and evaluated the influence of diameter and wood density measurements, plot number and size. We used a Test Zone (a defined surface area where a complete inventory was carried out, in addition to FAS and LIS), a Pilot Stand (a forest stand where both LIS and FAS methods were applied) and results from 10 field inventories in deciduous temperate forest stands with various conditions and amounts of FWD. Both methods, FAS and LIS, provided accurate (in trueness and precision) volume estimates, but LIS proved to be the more efficient. Diameter measurement was the main source of error: using the mean diameter, even by diameter class, led to an error for volume estimates of around 35\%. On the contrary, wood density measurements can be simplified without much influence on the accuracy of biomass estimates (use of mean density by diameter class). We show that the length and number of transects greatly influences the estimates, and that it is better to apply more, shorter transects than fewer, longer ones. Finally, we determined the optimal methodology and propose a simplification of some measurements to obtain the best time-precision trade-off for FWD inventories at the stand level.},

Based on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol, IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories were established. Nations that have signed the agreements are encouraged to quantify C pools and fluxes in their forests, including its proportion occurring as dead wood. There are significant differences in density and C concentration of dead wood among tree species. In managed hemiboreal forests of Estonia the dead wood density, and C and N concentration changes in different decay classes for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), silver and downy birch (Betula pendula Roth. and Betula pubescens Ehrh.), black alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn.), grey alder (Alnus incana (L.) Moench.) and European aspen (Populus tremula L.) have been assessed. All together 548 sample discs taken from logs (measurements were restricted to fallen dead trees only) were collected. The results revealed a decrease in mean dead wood density with progressing decay state for all studied tree species. Pine, spruce and grey alder had the smallest wood density reduction with progressing decay state, retaining 37\%, 30\%, and 36\% of initial density, respectively. Other broadleaved tree species (birch, black alder and aspen) had the greatest density reduction during decomposition, retaining 24\%, 23\%, and 16\% of initial density, respectively. For all studied tree species there were no significant differences of wood density between sites with different moisture conditions (dry, medium or wet areas). In case of pine, spruce and birch the C concentrations were significantly affected by the decay class, while in case of both alders and aspen the C concentrations were not significantly affected by changes in decay classes. For all the assessed tree species the N concentration in dead wood was increasing with increasing decay class.},

  abstract = {The influence of dry-wet cycles (DWC) on soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition is still debated given the somehow controversial results observed in the literature. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of DWC on SOC mineralization relative to various moisture controls in 7 treatments from two long-term French field experiments presenting contrasted SOC concentrations. A laboratory incubation was conducted for 97 days to quantify CO2 emissions upon four soil moisture scenarios: continuously wet scenario at pF 1.5 (WET), continuously moderate wet scenario at pF 2.5 (MWET), continuously dry scenario at pF 4.2 (DRY) and dry-wet cycles (DWC) between pF 1.5 and 4.2. Each cycle contained two phases, 10 days of drying phase, followed by 7 days of moist phase after rewetting. The drying phase consisted of adding silica gel to the incubation jars to absorb water in the soil and then gradually drying the soil. We also calculated the SOC mineralization that would correspond to the average water content in DWC (mean\_DWC). Our results showed that across all treatments the daily carbon mineralization rate increased with soil moisture (WET {$>$} MWET {$>$} DRY). In DWC scenario, mineralization rates fluctuated with the changes in soil moisture. As soils dried, daily mineralization rates decreased and the subsequent soil rewetting, to pF 1.5, caused a rapid mineralization flush or ``Birch effect''. However, these flushes did not compensate for the low mineralization rates in the drying phase as the cumulative mineralization was not higher in the DWC scenario compared to the mean\_DWC which was the scenario with equivalent water content as the DWC. We also observed that not accounting the CO2 emissions in the drying phase, could lead to an overestimation of the effect of DWC. We recommend to measure continuously the soil respiration during dry-wet experiments and to compare the CO2 emitted in DWC with a control that has a water content equivalent to the average water content in DWC. In addition, we questioned the importance of the effect of DWC on overall soil respiration.},

  abstract = {Our study examines dead wood dynamics in a series of permanent plots established in closed, productive second-growth forest stands of north-west Russia and in temporary plots that represent different successional stages and types of disturbance. Dead wood stores measured on 63 plots 0.2-1.0 ha in size range from 1-8 Mg C haa in young to mature intensively managed stands, 17 Mg C ha-{\textasciitilde}in an old-growth forest, 20 Mg C ha-t on a clear-cut, and 21-39 Mg C haa following a severe windthrow. A total of 122 logs, snags, and stumps aged by long-term plot records was sampled for decay rates and to develop a system of decay classes. Annual decomposition rates are: 3.3\% for pine, 3.4\% for spruce, and 4.5\% for birch. Based on these decay rates the average residence time of carbon (C) in the dead wood pool is 22-30 years. The mortality input on the permanent plots was 23-60 Mg C ha1 over 60 years of observation or 15-50\% of the total biomass increment. This data suggests a dead wood mass of 10-22 Mg C ha4 would be expected in these mature forests if salvage had not occurred. In old-growth forests, dead wood comprised about 20\% of the total wood mass, a proportion quite similar to the larger, more productive forests of the Pacific Northwest (USA). If this proportioning is characteristic of cool conifer forests it would be useful to estimate potential dead wood mass for old-growth forests without dead wood inventories. However, the use of a single live/dead wood ratio across the range of successional stages, a common practice in C budget calculations, may substantially over- or under-estimate the dead wood C pool depending upon the type of disturbance regime. Intensive forest management including short harvest rotations, thinning and wood sal{\textasciitilde},age reduces dead wood C stores to 5-40\% of the potential level found in undisturbed old-growth forest. In contrast, natural disturbance increases dead wood C pool by a factor of 2-4.},

This estimate assumes a widespread prevalence of continuous flooding of most rice fields and hence does not include emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), a long-lived greenhouse gas. Based on the belief that minimizing CH4 from rice cultivation is always climate beneficial, current mitigation policies promote increased use of intermittent flooding. However, results from five intermittently flooded rice farms across three agroecological regions in India indicate that N2O emissions per hectare can be three times higher (33 kg-N2O{$\cdot$}ha-1{$\cdot$}season-1) than the maximum previously reported. Correlations between N2O emissions and management parameters suggest that N2O emissions from rice across the Indian subcontinent might be 30-45 times higher under intensified use of intermittent flooding than under continuous flooding. Our data further indicate that comanagement of water with inorganic nitrogen and/or organic matter inputs can decrease climate impacts caused by greenhouse gas emissionsupto90\%andnitrogenmanagementmight not be central toN2Oreduction.An understanding of climate benefits/ drawbacks over time of different flooding regimes because of differences in N2O and CH4 emissions can help select the most climatefriendly water management regimes for a given area. Region-specific studies of rice farming practices that map flooding regimes and measure effects of multiple comanaged variables on N2O and CH4 emissions are necessary to determine and minimize the climate impacts of rice cultivation over both the short term and long term.},

Seven days with strongly reduced photosynthesis -12/60 h day/night period) resulted in only half of the total CO2 ef{\textasciimacron}ux from soil compared to the treatment with a 12/12 h day/ night period. The CO2 ef{\textasciimacron}ux from unplanted soil amounted to only 12and 20\% of the total CO 2 ef{\textasciimacron}ux from the soil with non-shaded and shaded plants, respectively. On average 75\% of total CO2 ef{\textasciimacron}ux from the planted soil with prolonged night periods was root-derived. Rhizosphere respiration was tightly coupled with plant photosynthetic activity. Any factor affecting photosynthesis, or substrate supply to roots and rhizosphere microorganisms, is an important determinant of root-derived CO2 ef{\textasciimacron}ux, and thereby, total CO2 ef{\textasciimacron}ux from soils. Clear diurnal dynamics of the total CO2 ef{\textasciimacron}ux intensity indicate the existence of an endogenous control mechanism of rhizosphere respiration. The light-on events after prolonged dark periods lead to strong increases of root-derived and therefore of total CO2 ef{\textasciimacron}ux from soil. After 14C pulse labeling, two maxima of the root-derived 14CO2 ef{\textasciimacron}ux were measured -6 and 24 h). This result demonstrated the diurnal dynamics of the rhizosphere respiration of recently-assimilated C in both the normal light conditions and shaded plants as well. The total amount of rootderived C respired in the rhizosphere was 17.3 and 20.6\% of the total assimilated C for non-shaded and shaded plants, respectively. Both methods used, 13C natural abundance and 14C pulse labeling, gave similar estimates of root-derived CO2 during the whole observation period: 1.80 {\textasciicircum} 0.27 and 1.67 {\textasciicircum} 0.37 mg C kg21 h21 -{\textasciicircum}SD), respectively. Both tracer methods show that the cultivation of wheat led to the increasing decomposition intensity of soil organic matter -priming effect). Additionally, 13C natural abundance allows tracing of the dynamics of the priming effect depending on the light-on events. q 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The water management system of cultivated paddy rice soils is one of the most important factors affecting the respective magnitudes of CH4 and N2O emissions. We hypothesized an effect of past management on soil microbial communities and greenhouse gas (GHG) production potential. The objectives of this study were to i) assess the influence of water management history on GHG production and microbial community structure, ii) relate GHG production to the microbial communities involved in CH4 and N2O production inhabiting the different soils. Moreover, the influence of different soil conditioning procedures on GHG production was determined. To reach these aims, we compared four soils with different water management history, using dried and sieved, pre-incubated and fresh soils. Soil conditioning procedures strongly affected GHG production: drying and sieving induced the highest production rates and the largest differences among soil types, probably through the release of labile substrates. Conversely, soil pre-incubation tended to homogenize and level out the differences among soils. The water management history strongly affected microbial community structure, which was itself tightly linked to CH4 and N2O production. N2O production was the highest in aerobic soil, which also exhibited the strongest evidence for active nitrifying communities (NirK). Drying and rewetting aerobic soil enhanced the production of nitrate, which was further reduced to N2O through denitrification. As expected, CH4 production was the lowest in aerobic soil, which showed a less abundant archaeal community. This work supports the hypothesis that microbial communities in paddy soils progressively adapt to water management practices, thereby reinforcing potential differences in GHGs production.},

  abstract = {Reducing CH4 and N2O emissions from rice cropping systems while sustaining production levels with less water requires a better understanding of the key processes involved. Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation is one promising practice that has been shown to reduce CH4 emissions. However, little is known about the impact of this practice on N2O emissions, in particular under Mediterranean climate. To close this knowledge gap, we assessed how AWD influenced grain yield, fluxes and annual budgets of CH4 and N2O emissions, and global warming potential (GWP) in Italian rice systems over a 2-year period. Overall, a larger GWP was observed under AWD, as a result of high N2O emissions which offset reductions in CH4 emissions. In the first year, with 70\% water reduction, the yields were reduced by 33\%, CH4 emissions decreased by 97\%, while N2O emissions increased by more than 5-fold under AWD as compared to PF; in the second year, with a 40\% water saving, the reductions of rice yields and CH4 emissions (13\% and 11\%, respectively) were not significant, but N2O fluxes more than doubled. The transition from anaerobic to aerobic soil conditions resulted in the highest N2O fluxes under AWD. The duration of flooding, transition to aerobic conditions, water level above the soil surface, and the relative timing between fertilization and flooding were the main drivers affecting greenhouse gas mitigation potential under AWD and should be carefully planned through site-specific management options.},

  abstract = {Rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivation is critically important for global food security, yet it also represents a significant fraction of agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and water resource use. Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) of rice fields has been shown to reduce both methane (CH4) emissions and water use, but its effect on grain yield is variable. In this three-year study we measured CH4 and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, rice grain total arsenic (As) concentrations, yield response to N rate, and grain yield from two AWD treatments (drill-seeded and water-seeded) and a conventionally managed water-seeded treatment (control). Grain yields (average = 10 Mg ha-1) were similar or higher in the AWD treatments compared to the control and required similar or lower N rates to achieve these yields. Furthermore, AWD reduced growing season CH4 emissions by 60-87\% while maintaining low annual N2O emissions (average = 0.38 kg N2O-N ha-1); N2O emissions accounted for {\textbackslash}textless15\% of the annual global warming potential (GWP) in all treatments. Fallow season emissions did not vary by treatment and accounted for 22-53\% of annual CH4 emissions and approximately one third of annual GWP on average. The AWD treatments reduced annual GWP by 57-74\% and growing season yield-scaled GWP by 59-88\%. Milled grain total As, which averaged 0.114 mg kg-1 in the control, was reduced by 59-65\% in the AWD treatments. These results show that AWD has the potential to mitigate GHG emissions associated with rice cultivation and reduce rice grain total As concentrations without sacrificing grain yield or requiring higher N inputs; however future research needs to focus on adapting AWD to field scales if adoption of this technology is to be realized.},

In this paper, we review progress in the development and dissemination of AWD in several Asian countries, and provide evidence of its extent of adoption and economic impact. AWD involves the partial drainage of rice fields, which is done by irrigating the fields to the desired depth and then re-irrigating after some time, when the water dissipates. To guide proper implementation, a simple, very low cost, farmer-friendly tool - a perforated "field water tube" - was devised. Demonstration trials and training have been conducted in eight countries in Asia, with large scale adoption in the Philippines, Vietnam and Bangladesh. AWD has reduced irrigation water input by up to 38\% with no yield reductions if implemented correctly. Water pumping expenses and fuel consumption decrease also, thus increasing farmers' income-by 38\% in Bangladesh, 32\% in the Philippines, and 17\% in southern Vietnam, based on "with and without" AWD comparison. The investment to develop and disseminate the AWD technology has a high rate of return, with benefit-cost ratio of 7:1. The evidence of economic benefits at the farm level when aggregated up more than compensates for the total research investments made to develop and disseminate the technology. Successful NARES partnerships and strong farmers' groups were critical factors in the validation and dissemination of the technology. AWD has also been successfully integrated into national government programs, which also facilitated the widespread adoption of the technology in these countries.},

The first was the spatial distribution of the necessary number of previous monthly amounts needed to predict the next amount. The second was the spatial distribution of discrepancies between the real recorded amount and those derived from the autoregressive process. The heterogeneous spatial distribution of both parameters of the ARIMA process is in accordance with the complex spatial distribution of the monthly rainfall regime in Catalonia and fractal/multifractal analyses of several monthly rainfall time series. The statistical distribution of monthly discrepancies also permits a prediction of the probable evolution at monthly scale of drought episodes in terms of length and accumulated rainfall deficit. The results of the ARIMA algorithm are characterized by a few cases of rain gauges with remarkable differences (10--20 mm{$\cdot$}month--1) between real and autoregressive amounts, a predominant number of emplacements lowering 10 mm{$\cdot$}month--1 and a not negligible number of cases with discrepancies lower than 5 mm{$\cdot$}month--1. In terms of percentages with respect to average monthly amounts, most of discrepancies do not exceed 15\%, and only in a very few cases they are within the 20--40\% range. It is also worth mentioning that the discrepancies between real and predicted drought lengths use to be no longer than 1 month. Results corresponding to monthly series recorded at two Earth Sciences observatories are described with more detail to illustrate the advantages offered by the ARIMA autoregressive process in the prediction of beginning, continuity and end of drought episodes.},

However, SOM is incredibly complex and requires separation into multiple components with contrasting behavior in order to study and predict its dynamics. Numerous diverse SOM separation schemes are currently used, making cross-study comparisons difficult and hindering broad-scale generalizations. Here, we recommend separating SOM into particulate (POM) and mineral-associated (MAOM) forms, two SOM components that are fundamentally different in terms of their formation, persistence, and functioning. We provide evidence of their highly contrasting physical and chemical properties, mean residence times in soil, and responses to land use change, plant litter inputs, warming, CO2 enrichment, and N fertilization. Conceptualizing SOM into POM versus MAOM is a feasible, well-supported, and useful framework that will allow scientists to move beyond studies of bulk SOM, but also use a consistent separation scheme across studies. Ultimately, we propose the POM versus MAOM framework as the best way forward to understand and predict broad-scale SOM dynamics in the context of global change challenges and provide necessary recommendations to managers and policy makers.},

  abstract = {Rice fields are temporary wetlands that harbor many of the same species that breed in natural temporary ponds. Therefore the rice agroecosystem has the potential to help sustain the regional biodiversity of many invertebrates and vertebrates. Like natural areas of wetlands, rice cultivation provides a habitat mosaic of temporary and more permanent waters. Because of their low floral diversity and because their species composition will rarely overlap completely with that of natural ponds, rice fields are not substitutes for natural temporary ponds. However, they are important in sustaining populations of several species, including wading birds and frogs. Farming methods vary widely, and different practices can alter the suitability of rice fields as habitats. Farmers use water management, pesticides, and sometimes fish to control crop pests and mosquitoes, and other taxa may be affected as well. Farmers may irrigate rice intermittently to control pests, and intermittent habitat holds fewer species than areas that are flooded for longer periods. Broad-spectrum pesticides may harm invertebrates and other wildlife, and may even cause pest resurgences if they have greater effects on predator populations than on the pests. Fish often decrease the abundance of invertebrate predators, but fish farming in rice fields often discourages the use of harmful pesticides. Because farming practices can affect the conservation value of rice fields, ecologists are encouraged to work with farmers and study the role of rice fields in the population dynamics of temporary pond species, and how changing farming methods alter this role.},

  abstract = {Sustainable intensification of rice farming is crucial to meeting human food needs while reducing environmental impacts. Rice production represents 8\% of all anthropogenic emissions of CH4, a potent greenhouse gas. Cultivation practices that minimize the number of days the rice fields are flooded, such as irrigation using the alternate wetting and drying (AWD) technique instead of continuous flooding (DF) can potentially reduce CH4 emissions. Ratoon cropping, wherein a second crop of rice is grown from the harvested stubble of the first crop, can produce additional yield with minimal labor but may generate more CH4 than single cropping. The objectives of this study were first to test different water management regimes for their impact on yield and CH4 emissions, and second to investigate CH4 emissions from a ratoon crop and perform an exploratory economic analysis of ratoon cropping. Two adjacent fields in Lonoke County, Arkansas were compared under different irrigation treatments from 2015 through 2020; the 2020 season also included a ratoon crop. Field-scale CH4 emissions were measured using the eddy covariance method at each field. AWD reduced CH4 emissions by 79.5\% on average in comparison to DF for the main seasons. Across the field-seasons, the emissions from the main crop ranged from 77.2 to 132.5 kg CH4-C ha-1 under DF and from 7.1 to 40.7 kg CH4-C ha-1 under AWD. The ratoon crop generated emissions from 39.7 to 50.7 kg CH4-C ha-1, up to a 3.6-fold increase from the main crop of the same year. CH4 emissions from the ratoon crop in this study were much lower than those found in previous ratoon studies. The ratoon crop yield was 13\% that of the main crop yield on average but there was no significant difference in yield between irrigation treatments for the main seasons.},

  abstract = {The contribution of alternate wetting and drying (AWD) to mitigating soil methane (CH4) emissions from rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivation is well known, but the trade-off among soil CH4 emissions reduction, rice yields and agronomic management is less clear. This study carried out a structured interview and life cycle assessment to explore the influence of AWD on life-cycle greenhouse gas (LC-GHG) emissions, yields and agronomic management in An Giang Province, Vietnam, which is the 5th-largest rice producer in the world. Farmers in An Giang Province were trained in a course that introduced them to AWD as a technological package known as `one must do, five reductions'. All farmers interviewed who attended the course reported that they were implementing AWD (AWD farmers), whereas interviewed farmers who did not attend the course reported that they did not implement AWD (non-AWD farmers). The present study showed that yields were almost identical among the AWD and non-AWD farmers. Irrespective of the water management, on-site burning was practised as straw management by {\textbackslash}textgreater75\% of farmers. Due to the influence of the technological campaigns, AWD allowed farmers in An Giang Province to reduce LC-GHG emissions without decreasing yields significantly and with lower use of fertilizers (nitrogen and phosphate) and seeds. Furthermore, the results suggest that a reduction in the use of fertilizer and seed does not reduce yields significantly for either AWD or non-AWD farmers, but careful straw management is required to avoid an increase in LC-GHG emissions.},

Extrapolation of the mitigation potential of alternative management practices from field studies to a national scale may be enhanced by spatially explicit process models, like the DeNitrification and DeComposition (DNDC) model. Our objective was to analyze the impacts of mitigation alternatives, management of water, fertilizer, and rice straw, on net GHG emissions (carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide fluxes), yields, and water use. After constructing a GIS database of soil, climate, rice cropping area and systems, and management practices, we ran DNDC with 21-yr alternative management schemes for each of the approximately 2500 counties in China. Results indicate that, despite large-scale adoption of midseason drainage, there is still large potential for additional methane reductions from Chinese rice paddies of 20 to 60\% over 2000--2020. However, changes in management for reducing CH 4 emissions simultaneously affect soil carbon dynamics as well as N 2 O emissions and can thereby reorder the ranking of technical mitigation effectiveness. The order of net GHG emissions reduction effectiveness found here is upland rice {\textbackslash}textgreater shallow flooding {\textbackslash}textgreater ammonium sulfate {\textbackslash}textgreater midseason drainage {\textbackslash}textgreater off-season straw {\textbackslash}textgreater slow-release fertilizer {\textbackslash}textgreater continuous flooding. Most of the management alternatives produced yields comparable to the baseline; however, continuous flooding and upland rice significantly reduced yields. Water management strategies appear to be the most technically promising GHG mitigation alternatives, with shallow flooding providing additional benefits of both water conservation and increased yields.},

The CH4 and CO2 fluxes for early rice ranged from-2.52mgm-2h-1 to 125.0mgm-2h-1 and from 99.3mgm-2h-1 to 1463.6mgm-2h-1, respectively, whereas the fluxes for late rice varied from-7.22mgm-2h-1 to 242.3mgm-2h-1 and from 180.6mgm-2h-1 to 2219.0mgm-2h-1, respectively. Compared with NT, CT significantly increased (P{\textbackslash}textless0.05) the CH4 and CO2 emissions, where the seasonal total CH4 emissions from the CT treatment were 1.75-2.10 times of those from the NT treatment for early rice and 1.64-1.79 times for late rice. Moreover, compared with the CT treatment, the NT treatment significantly reduced seasonal total CO2 emissions by 19\%-33\% for early rice (P{\textbackslash}textless0.05) and by 27\%-31\% for late rice (P{\textbackslash}textless0.05). The seeding methods significantly affected CH4 and CO2 emissions.

A two-year field experiment was conducted to study the combined effect of timing and duration of midseason aeration and wheat straw incorporation on mitigation of global warming potential (GWP) of CH4 and N2O emissions from irrigated lowland rice paddy fields. Results showed that incorporation of wheat straw increased CH4 by a factor of 5-9 under various water regimes, but simultaneously decreased N2O emission by 19-42 \% during the rice growing season. Without straw incorporation, prolonged aeration significantly reduced the net 100-year GWP of CH4 and N2O emissions by 6 \%, but also decreased rice production when compared with normal aeration. With straw incorporation, the lowest GWP was found by early aeration, which reduced GWP by 7 and 20 \% in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Estimation of net GWPs of CH4 and N2O emissions indicated that early midseason drainage with straw incorporation offered the potential to mitigate CH4 and N2O emissions from irrigated lowland rice paddies in China. {\copyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

  abstract = {The impact of climate change on rice yield varies among different rice varieties. Designing effective agronomic adaptation strategies is crucial for global rice provision. However, considerable uncertainty remains as to which approaches/strategies should be used in different regions. To this end, we conducted a meta-analysis aimed at quantifying firstly the marginal effects of climate change (i.e., temperature, precipitation, and CO2) and four adaptation strategies (i.e., changing varieties, adjusting fertilization, adjusting irrigation, and altering planting dates) on rice yield in Indica, Japonica, and Hybrid rice. We further assessed climate risks to rice yield and identified optimum adaptation strategies under three shared socio-economic pathway (SSP) scenarios. The results of the meta-analysis showed that temperature has the greatest negative marginal effect of -3.11\% on rice yield, with changing varieties being the most effective strategy (15.93\%) to counter this effect, followed by increased irrigation (0.24\%). Projected climate scenarios predict a 2.11\% global average rice yield decrease in the 2040s under SSP5-8.5. Japonica rice yields are significantly more pessimistic than Indica and Hybrid rice. To offset this, 86.48\% of the rice planting area would need to change varieties; increase fertilization and irrigation by 51.22\% and 8.54\%, respectively; or plant in advance by 13 days. Major rice-producing countries such as India, China, and Brazil will need adaptation strategies with higher urgency and scale than the global average. These findings form a basis for a better understanding of climate resilience in different rice varieties and agronomic strategies. Our analysis suggests that it is possible for future rice yield to meet the needs of rice-growing countries while supporting eco-friendly rice production if the appropriate measures are taken. Overall, this study attempts firstly to design effective agronomic adaptation strategies to enhance rice production resilience against climate change and advance understanding of rice varietal adaptation for improved management.

  abstract = {Current water-nitrogen (N) management strategies are necessary to be improved to increase crop productivity while reducing environmental costs. However, the effects of improved water-N management strategies on paddy CH4 and N2O emissions simultaneously generated during the growing and non-growing seasons have not been explored. Therefore, in this study, four water-N management practices---urea plus conventional irrigation (UREA+CI), urea plus alternate wetting-drying irrigation (UREA+AWD), controlled-release N fertilizer plus CI (CRNF+CI), and CRNF plus AWD (CRNF+AWD)---were evaluated in a 3-year field experiment following a randomized complete block design with three replications each. The results demonstrated that during rice growing seasons, CH4 emissions significantly decreased by 12.6--44.9\% under UREA+AWD and by 17.2--32.1\% under CRNF+CI, compared to UREA+CI, respectively, and CRNF+SWD showed the highest mitigation potential. N2O emissions were reduced in CRNF treatments (CRNF+CI and CRNF+AWD) but increased by replacing CI with AWD during rice growing seasons, suggesting the potential effects of water regimes on N2O emissions. Furthermore, AWD and CRNF reduced CH4 emissions during the land preparation period before the late rice growing season and the fallow period, whereas CRNF treatments triggered the release of N2O in the fallow period. Moreover, there were no significant differences in soil organic carbon sequestration rates among the treatments. The results indicated that AWD, CRNF and their combination significantly reduced annual net total greenhouse gas emissions without yield loss. Collectively, this study unravels the potential of alternative water-N management strategies to improve rice yields while minimizing GHG emissions in double rice cropping systems.},

Cereals (rice, wheat, and maize) are the largest source of human calories, and it is estimated that world cereal production must increase by 1.3\% annually to 2025 to meet growing demand. Sustainable intensification of cereal production systems will require maintaining high yields while reducing environmental costs. We conducted a meta-analysis (57 published studies consisting of 62 study sites and 328 observations) to test the hypothesis that the global warming potential (GWP) of CH 4 and N 2O emissions from rice, wheat, and maize, when expressed per ton of grain (yield-scaled GWP), is similar, and that the lowest value for each cereal is achieved at near optimal yields. Results show that the GWP of CH 4 and N 2O emissions from rice (3757 kg CO 2 eq ha -1 season -1) was higher than wheat (662 kg CO 2eq ha -1 season -1) and maize (1399 kg CO 2 eq ha -1 season -1). The yield-scaled GWP of rice was about four times higher (657 kg CO 2 eq Mg -1) than wheat (166 kg CO 2 eq Mg -1) and maize (185 kg CO 2 eq Mg -1). Across cereals, the lowest yield-scaled GWP values were achieved at 92\% of maximal yield and were about twice as high for rice (279 kg CO 2 eq Mg -1) than wheat (102 kg CO 2 eq Mg -1) or maize (140 kg CO 2 eq Mg -1), suggesting greater mitigation opportunities for rice systems. In rice, wheat and maize, 0.68\%, 1.21\%, and 1.06\% of N applied was emitted as N 2O, respectively. In rice systems, there was no correlation between CH 4 emissions and N rate. In addition, when evaluating issues related to food security and environmental sustainability, other factors including cultural significance, the provisioning of ecosystem services, and human health and well-being must also be considered. {\copyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Rice (Oryza sativa), the staple crop for the largest number of people on earth, is grown under flooded soil conditions and uses more water and has higher greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than most crops. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that alternate wetting and drying (AWD -- flooding the soil and then allowing to dry down before being reflooded) water management practices will maintain grain yields and concurrently reduce water use, greenhouse gas emissions and arsenic (As) levels in rice. Various treatments ranging in frequency and duration of AWD practices were evaluated at three locations over 2 years. Relative to the flooded control treatment and depending on the AWD treatment, yields were reduced by {$<$}1--13\%; water-use efficiency was improved by 18--63\%, global warming potential (GWP of CH4 and N2O emissions) reduced by 45--90\%, and grain As concentrations reduced by up to 64\%. In general, as the severity of AWD increased by allowing the soil to dry out more between flood events, yields declined while the other benefits increased. The reduction in GWP was mostly attributed to a reduction in CH4 emissions as changes in N2O emissions were minimal among treatments. When AWD was practiced early in the growing season followed by flooding for remainder of season, similar yields as the flooded control were obtained but reduced water use (18\%), GWP (45\%) and yield-scaled GWP (45\%); although grain As concentrations were similar or higher. This highlights that multiple environmental benefits can be realized without sacrificing yield but there may be trade-offs to consider. Importantly, adoption of these practices will require that they are economically attractive and can be adapted to field scales.},

Using meta-analytic and regression approaches, existing data from the United States were examined to quantify GHG emissions and major practices affecting emissions. Due to different production practices, major rice production regions were defined as the mid-South (Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Missouri) and California, with emissions being evaluated separately. Average growing season CH4 emissions for the mid-South and California were 194 (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 129--260) and 218 kg CH4 ha-1 season-1 (95\% CI = 153--284), respectively. Growing season N2O emissions were similar between regions (0.14 kg N2O ha-1 season-1). Ratoon cropping (allowing an additional harvestable crop to grow from stubble after the initial harvest), common along the Gulf Coast of the mid-South, had average CH4 emissions of 540 kg CH4 ha-1 season-1 (95\% CI = 465--614). Water and residue management practices such as alternate wetting and drying, and stand establishment method (water vs. dry seeding), and the amount of residue from the previous crop had the largest effect on growing season CH4 emissions. However, soil texture, sulfate additions, and cultivar selection also affected growing season CH4 emissions. This analysis can be used for the development of tools to estimate and mitigate GHG emissions from US rice systems and other similarly mechanized systems in temperate regions.},

  abstract = {Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is the primary staple food for more people than any other crop, but it is also a significant source of methane (CH4) emissions and arsenic (As) in the human diet. For organic rice, these factors pose a greater challenge due to the use of organic fertilizers and that organic rice consumers often prefer brown rice. A major management challenge for organic rice producers is weed control. In California, organic producers have developed a practice to control weeds that involves a severe dry-down (DD) about 30 days after planting. Our objective was to determine the impact of a DD on greenhouse gas emissions and grain As and cadmium (Cd) concentrations compared to a continuously flooded (CF) control. The DD treatment reduced seasonal CH4 emissions by 50\% (from 359 to 181 kg CH4 ha-1). Only during the DD period were nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions detected, but cumulative emissions were low (0.35 kg N2O ha-1). The global warming potential (GWP) was reduced by 49\% in the DD treatment relative to the CF. Grain As and Cd concentrations were not at levels deemed a health concern in any treatment. However, grain As concentrations in the DD treatment were reduced by 30\% and 37\% in brown and white rice, respectively. Under the DD treatment, Cd concentrations increased but remained low. This study confirms that the weed management DD practice has a positive effect on GWP and grain As concentrations. In Cd contaminated soils, this practice may not be advisable.},

  abstract = {The effects of management in maintaining high rice yield with less water have received increasing attention in sub-tropical regions where seasonal drought is very severe. To test whether water management affects soil ecological process we compared the soil nematode communities in paddy field soils following water management treatments imposed during late rice cropping. The treatments were continuously flooded rice cultivation (CF), noncontinuously flooded rice cultivations without (ZM) and with (M) rice straw mulching. A sequential extraction procedure involving Baermann extraction (Baermann) followed by centrifugal sugar flotation (centrifugation) was used to extract the whole nematode community. Based on the analysis of nematode abundance, genera composition, trophic groups and other ecological indices (Margalef richness index, Shannon index, maturity index, enrichment index and structure index), water management significantly affected the nematode community, with the non-continuously flooded condition, in particular combination with rice straw mulching (M), stimulating nematode development. There was a high abundance, richness, and structure in the nematode community in mulched treatments, indicating improved biodiversity and biological interactions. We hypothesize that soil microclimate and available food resources are affected by water management and directly or indirectly influence the establishment of different nematode communities. We suggested that studies aiming to test natural or anthropogenic influences on nematodes might be distorted by sole use of the Baermann method. Although the Baermann step in a sequential extraction procedure gave valuable information on nematode responses to soil treatments, it was not sufficient to detect effects on the whole nematode community. Our results demonstrate that the sequential extraction procedure is an effective tool to obtain comprehensive information on the whole nematode community, with both steps providing complementary ecologically relevant information, on how the soil ecosystem is affected by human management.},

The soil CO2 flux rates ranged from -0.45 to 8.62 {$\mu$}mol.m-2.s-1 during the rice-growing season. The net effluxes of CO2 from the paddy soil were lower when the paddy was flooded than when it was drained. The CO2 emissions for the drained conditions showed distinct diurnal variation with a maximum efflux observed in the afternoon. When the paddy was flooded, daytime soil CO2 fluxes reversed with a peak negative efflux just after midday. In draining/flooding alternating periods, a sudden pulse-like event of rapidly increasing CO2 efflux occured in response to re-flooding after draining. Correlation analysis showed a negative relation between soil CO2 flux and temperature under flooded conditions, but a positive relation was found under drained conditions. The results showed that draining and flooding cycles play a vital role in controlling CO2 emissions from paddy soils. {\copyright} 2013 Liu et al.},

Microbial biodiversity, and especially that of decomposers, plays a key role in these processes by helping litter decomposition. Yet the relative contribution of litter diversity and soil biodiversity in supporting multiple ecosystem services remains virtually unknown. Here we conducted a mesocosm experiment where leaf litter and soil biodiversity were manipulated to investigate their influence on plant productivity, litter decomposition, soil respiration, and enzymatic activity in the littersphere. We showed that both leaf litter diversity and soil microbial diversity (richness and community composition) independently contributed to explain multiple ecosystem functions. Fungal saprobes community composition was especially important for supporting ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF), plant production, litter decomposition, and activity of soil phosphatase when compared with bacteria or other fungal functional groups and litter species richness. Moreover, leaf litter diversity and soil microbial diversity exerted previously undescribed and significantly interactive effects on EMF and multiple individual ecosystem functions, such as litter decomposition and plant production. Together, our work provides experimental evidence supporting the independent and interactive roles of litter and belowground soil biodiversity to maintain ecosystem functions and multiple services.},

  abstract = {The availability of water is a growing concern for flooded rice production. As such, several watersaving irrigation practices have been developed to reduce water requirements. Alternate wetting and drying and mid-season drainage have been shown to potentially reduce water requirements while maintaining rice yields when compared to continuous flooding. With the removal of permanently anaerobic conditions during the growing season, water-saving irrigation can also reduce CO2 equivalent (CO2eq) emissions, helping reduce the impact of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the long-term impact of water-saving irrigation on soil organic carbon (SOC)---used here as an indicator of soil health and fertility---has not been explored. We therefore conducted a metaanalysis to assess the effects of common water-saving irrigation practices (alternate wetting and drying and mid-season drainage) on (i) SOC, and (ii) GHG emissions. Despite an extensive literature search, only 12 studies were found containing data to constrain the soil C balance in both continuous flooding and water-saving irrigation plots, highlighting the still limited understanding of long-term impacts of water-saving irrigation on soil health and GHG emissions. Water-saving irrigation was found to reduce emissions of CH4 by 52.3\% and increased those of CO2 by 44.8\%. CO2eq emissions were thereby reduced by 18.6\% but the soil-to-atmosphere carbon (C) flux increased by 25\% when compared to continuous flooding. Water-saving irrigation was also found to have a negative effect on both SOC---reducing concentrations by 5.2\%---and soil organic nitrogen---potentially depleting stocks by more than 100 kg N/ha per year. While negative effects of water-saving irrigation on rice yield may not be visible in short-term experiments, care should be taken when assessing the long-term sustainability of these irrigation practices because they can decrease soil fertility. Strategies need to be developed for assessing the more long-term effects of these irrigation practices by considering tradeoffs between water savings and other ecosystem services.},

  abstract = {Although many activities can jointly contribute to the climate change strategies of adaptation and mitigation, climate policies have generally treated these strategies separately. In recent years, there has been a growing interest shown by practitioners in agriculture, forestry, and landscape management in the links between the two strategies. This review explores the opportunities and trade-offs when managing landscapes for both climate change mitigation and adaptation; different conceptualizations of the links between adaptation and mitigation are highlighted. Under a first conceptualization of `joint outcomes,' several reviewed studies analyze how activities without climatic objectives deliver joint adaptation and mitigation outcomes. In a second conceptualization of `unintended side effects,' the focus is on how activities aimed at only one climate objective---either adaptation or mitigation---can deliver outcomes for the other objective. A third conceptualization of `joint objectives' highlights that associating both adaptation and mitigation objectives in a climate-related activity can influence its outcomes because of multiple possible interactions. The review reveals a diversity of reasons for mainstreaming adaptation and mitigation separately or jointly in landscape management. The three broad conceptualizations of the links between adaptation and mitigation suggest different implications for climate policy mainstreaming and integration.

  abstract = {As the province with the most beef cattle, the second-largest number of farms and farmed area in the country, and as one of Canada's biggest producers of crops, Alberta is a huge part of the national agriculture sector. It has also been responsible for the highest level of agricultural greenhouse-gas emissions in the country. However, there has been little exploration to date of the effectiveness of using carbon credits to encourage Alberta farmers to practise farming techniques that lower emissions, while earning extra revenue without jeopardizing their agricultural output. In trying to achieve their carbon-reduction targets under the Paris agreement, governments should be considering their agricultural sectors. Participating in a carbon-credit system allows farmers to generate credits for reducing emissions; they can then sell those credits for cash on a credit market to emitters who need to purchase carbon-offset allowances for exceeding their mandated emission limits. Despite there being an active carbon-offset market in Alberta, however, farmers in the province hardly participate. This appears partly due to a history of regulatory risk: the agriculture sector has seen the revocation of carbon-credit eligibility for certain practices, and invalidated credits can lead to significant financial losses for farmers. Farmers are also reluctant to participate due to the inadequacy of offset-credit revenues in covering the foregone costs of implementing emission-reduction practices given current carbon-offset prices and the emissions level per farm. Some lower-emission farming protocols have proved profitable for farmers by improving efficiency, even without carbon-offset incentives. While farmers may adopt these practices for their own reasons, they are reluctant to participate in Alberta's carbon-offset market unless they are sufficiently rewarded. Market conditions thus far have not encouraged them to do so. Alberta farmers may continue to largely sit out the carbon-credit market until returns for earning credits become more stable and more rewarding. Alberta policy-makers should emphasize the intrinsic efficiency benefits to farmers of implementing these protocols for their own sake. Convincing farmers in the province to invest in emission-reducing technologies for the purpose of making money in the current Alberta carbon market will, for the time being, remain a difficult sell. 2 ABSTRACT Carbon-credit systems allow agricultural producers to earn an extra revenue through selling their surplus of carbon credits to producers who emit higher amounts of greenhouse gases (GHGs). However, agricultural carbon-credit systems are still at early stage; hence, these benefits cannot be guaranteed due to their uncertain nature and the paucity of scientific evidence about agricultural carbon credits. The objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive literature review to highlight the gaps in existing knowledge related to agricultural carbon credits/ offsets. Our particular interest is on Alberta because the province indicates the highest agricultural GHG emissions from 1990 to 2019 and, therefore, developing strategies to reduce the sector's carbon intensity without compromising its economic contribution to the provincial economy poses a challenge.},

Our objectives were to determine whether the seasonal dynamics of microbial biomass C (MBC) was related to the release of organic substance from rice roots. MBC and the dissolved organic C (DOC) in soil solutions were measured over a growing period of rice plants in a pot experiment. The 13C pulse labelling (through supplying rice plants with 13CO2 for 6 h) was performed at different growth stages of rice to estimate the contribution of photosynthesized C to MBC. DOC concentrations increased with plant growth, reflecting the release of soluble root exudates from rice roots. MBC declined in the early period, and then rapidly increased from the maximum tillering stage to the heading stage of rice. During this period of increase, MBC was positively correlated to the DOC concentration and root biomass. About 0.15--0.94\% (mean 0.54\%) of photosynthesized 13C was incorporated into MBC immediately after pulse labelling, and 0.18--0.75\% (mean 0.41\%) still remained at the end of the season. The estimated total contribution of photosynthates to MBC amounted to 91 mg C plant--1, corresponding to 28\% of total MBC at the end of the season or a 100\% increase in MBC over the growing season. The results suggest that MBC dynamics in rice soil are largely controlled by organic substances released from rice roots.},

  abstract = {``4 per 1000 Initiative'' launched at COP21 has strongly recommended that increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) is a global imperative. However, the strategies to improve agricultural soil functioning and health by an increase in soil C have been poorly addressed. In a rice farm trail, topsoil samples were collected in 2015 respectively in a field amended with biochar (BA) (equivalent to 10 t ha-1) in 2009 and an adjacent field with no biochar (NB). Soil aggregation, biochemical activities and microbial communities of the samples were analyzed with microscopic, micro-biochemical and molecular assays respectively. Compared to NB field, SOC storage increased by 45\%, total and available nitrogen pool enhanced by approximately 30\% while the bulk density decreased and soil pH unchanged in BA field. A 25\% increase in mean weight diameter of water stable aggregates was observed in the BA compared to NB field. Correspondingly, microbial biomass nitrogen and enzyme activities in BA field was enhanced both by approximately 30\% compared to NB field. Furthermore, with community structure altered, a moderate (32\%) increase in total bacterial abundance and a significant decrease in microbial abundance of amino acid metabolism and fungal pathotrophs were observed in BA field compared to NB field. This could link to the higher (10\%) grain yield with lower yield inter-annual variability in BA field compared to NB field, reported previously. All these changes clearly demonstrated a legacy of paddy soil health improvement over years following one time biochar amendment. Overall, addition of biochar to the clayey nutrient rich paddy soil could sustain an increase in SOC, soil aggregation and soil health functioning, with positive changes in microbial community over years. Thus, carbon increase as per required by the ``4 per 1000 Initiative'' could be a mechanistic driver to enhance soil fertility and improve soil-(plant) health for ensuring food production in world rice agriculture facing land degradation and climate change impacts, which could be assisted by biochar from crop residue in an approach of circular economy.},

  abstract = {Rice fields can be considered man-managed temporary wetlands. Five rice fields handled with different management strategies, their adjacent channels, and a spring were analysed by their benthic macroinvertebrate community to i) evaluate the role of rice agroecosystem in biodiversity conservation; ii) find indicator species which can be used to compare the ecological status of natural wetlands with rice agroecosystems; and iii) find the influence of environmental variables on biodiversity. Different methods of data analysis with increasing degree of complexity -- from diversity index up to sophisticated multivariate analysis -- were used. The investigation provided a picture of benthic macroinvertebrates inhabiting rice agroecosystems where 173 taxa were identified, 89 of which detected in rice paddies. Among them, 4 phyla (Mollusca, Annelida, Nematomorpha, and Arthropoda), 8 classes (Bivalvia, Gastropoda, Oligochaeta, Hirudinea, Gordioida, Insecta, Branchiopoda, and Malacostraca), 24 orders, 68 families, 127 genera and 159 species have been found. Ten threatened and 3 invasive species were detected in the habitats examined. The information obtained by the different methods of data analysis allowed a more comprehensive view on the value of the components of rice agroecosystems. Data analyses highlighted significant differences between habitats (feeding channel and rice field), with higher diversity observed in channels, and emphasised the role of the water chemical-physical parameters. The period of water permanence in rice fields resulted to be only one of the factors influencing the community of benthic macroinvertebrates. The presence of rare/endangered species allowed characterising some stations, but it was less informative about management strategies in rice paddies because most of these species were absent in rice fields.},

The aquatic Coleoptera have been collected monthly from channels, rice fields and a natural spring for one year, resulting in 31 species belonging to 8 families (Brachyceridae, Dytiscidae, Dryopidae, Elmidae, Gyrinidae, Haliplidae, Helophoridae, Hydrophilidae) which have been identified, 19 of which in rice paddies. The comparison of paddies subjected to different anthropogenic impacts shows that the flooding period is only one of the factors influencing the community of water beetles. Important information on the occurrence of the species during the year is also provided and adds to the few knowledge present in the literature. All the data, as well as the detection of vulnerable and rare species, evidence that rice agro-ecosystems are essential for the exploitation of water beetle biodiversity in areas densely colonized, industrialized and cultivated, where wetlands has strongly reduced over the last centuries.},

  abstract = {The methanotrophs in rice field soil are crucial in regulating the emission of methane. Drainage substantially reduces methane emission from rice fields. However, it is poorly understood how drainage affects microbial methane oxidation. Therefore, we analyzed the dynamics of methane oxidation rates, composition (using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism [T-RFLP]), and abundance (using quantitative PCR [qPCR]) of methanotroph pmoA genes (encoding a subunit of particulate methane monooxygenase) and their transcripts over the season and in response to alternate dry/wet cycles in planted paddy field microcosms. In situ methane oxidation accounted for less than 15\% of total methane production but was enhanced by intermittent drainage. The dry/wet alternations resulted in distinct effects on the methanotrophic communities in different soil compartments (bulk soil, rhizosphere soil, surface soil). The methanotrophic communities of the different soil compartments also showed distinct seasonal dynamics. In bulk soil, potential methanotrophic activity and transcription of pmoA were relatively low but were significantly stimulated by drainage. In contrast, however, in the rhizosphere and surface soils, potential methanotrophic activity and pmoA transcription were relatively high but decreased after drainage events and resumed after reflooding. While type II methanotrophs dominated the communities in the bulk soil and rhizosphere soil compartments (and to a lesser extent also in the surface soil), it was the pmoA of type I methanotrophs that was mainly transcribed under flooded conditions. Drainage affected the composition of the methanotrophic community only minimally but strongly affected metabolically active methanotrophs. Our study revealed dramatic dynamics in the abundance, composition, and activity of the various type I and type II methanotrophs on both a seasonal and a spatial scale and showed strong effects of dry/wetalternation cycles, which enhancedthe attenuation of methane flux into the atmosphere. {\copyright} 2013, American Society for Microbiology.},

Multifunctionality was positively and significantly related to species richness. The best-fitting models accounted for over 55\% of the variation in multifunctionality and always included species richness as a predictor variable.

  abstract = {Worldwide, forests have absorbed around 30\% of global anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) annually, thereby acting as important carbon (C) sinks. It is proposed that leaving large fragments of dead wood, coarse woody debris (CWD), in forest ecosystems may contribute to the forest C sink strength. CWD may take years to centuries to degrade completely, and non-respired C from CWD may enter the forest soil directly or in the form of dissolved organic C. Although aboveground decomposition of CWD has been studied frequently, little is known about the relative size, composition and fate of different C fluxes from CWD to soils under various substrate-specific and environmental conditions. Thus, the exact contribution of C from CWD to C sequestration within forest soils is poorly understood and quantified, although understanding CWD degradation and stabilization processes is essential for effective forest C sink management. This review aims at providing insight into these processes on the interface of forest ecology and soil science, and identifies knowledge gaps that are critical to our understanding of the effects of CWD on the forest soil C sink. It may be seen as a ``call-to-action'' crossing disciplinary boundaries, which proposes the use of compound-specific analytical studies and manipulation studies to elucidate C fluxes from CWD. Carbon fluxes from decaying CWD can vary considerably due to interspecific and intraspecific differences in composition and different environmental conditions. These variations in C fluxes need to be studied in detail and related to recent advances in soil C sequestration research. Outcomes of this review show that the presence of CWD may enhance the abundance and diversity of the microbial community and constitute additional fluxes of C into the mineral soil by augmented leaching of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Leached DOC and residues from organic matter (OM) from later decay stages have been shown to be relatively enriched in complex and microbial-derived compounds, which may also be true for CWD-derived OM. Emerging knowledge on soil C stabilization indicates that such complex compounds may be sorbed preferentially to the mineral soil. Moreover, increased abundance and diversity of decomposer organisms may increase the amount of substrate C being diverted into microbial biomass, which may contribute to stable C pools in the forest soil.},

  abstract = {Decaying dead wood density measurements are a useful indicator for multiple purposes, such as for estimating the amount of carbon in dead wood and making predictions of potential diversity of dead wood inhabiting fungi and insects. Currently, qualitative decay phases are used as wood density estimates in many applications, since measuring the density is laborious. A quantitative measure of density would, however, be preferred over the qualitative one. Penetrometers, which are commonly used for measuring the density of standing trees, might also be applicable to dead wood density measurements. We tested the device for making quick, quantitative measurements of decaying logs. The penetrometer measures the depth into which a pre-loaded spring forces a pin in the wood. We tested pins of 5 and 10 mm diameter together with an original 2.5 mm pin and compared the results with gravimetric density measurements of the sample logs. Our results suggest that the standard pin works for less decayed wood, but for more decomposed wood, the thicker 5 mm pin gave more reliable estimates when the penetration measures were converted to densities with a linear regression function (R2=0.62, F=82.9, p=0.000). The range of wood densities successfully measured with the 5 mm pin was from 180 to 510 kg m--3. With the 10 mm pin, the measuring resolution of denser wood was compromised, while the improvement at the other end of density scale was not large. As a conclusion, the penetrometer seems to be a promising tool for quick density testing of decaying logs in field, but it needs to be modified to use a thicker measuring pin than the standard 2.5 mm pin.},

Conversely, organic agriculture (OA) is envisaged as potentially enhancing helpful microbial communities and is proposed as environmentally sustainable. The soil microbiome influences soil health and quality, hence, it requires deeper investigation and understanding. In this study, applying 16S metabarcoding and qPCR techniques, we compared the microbial patterns of long-term organically and conventionally managed soils to explore their similarities and differences. Results: Total DNA quantification showed an over 20-fold higher amount of DNA in OA soils (mean = 22.1 {\textpm} 3.92 {$\mu$}g g-1), compared to CA soils (mean = 0.95 {\textpm} 0.17 {$\mu$}g g-1). While 16S metabarcoding evidenced the absence of significant differences among communities of the two farming systems in terms of ecological indices, the qPCR analyses targeting functional genes reported a significantly higher abundance of all considered targets in OA sites spanning up to four-fold log increases. While OA and CA did not appear to affect overall bacterial diversity or evenness per se, qPCR-based functional analysis in OA showed a consistently higher abundance of all the salient microbial genes tested, when compared to CA, underlying a potentially beneficial impact on soil fertility and sustainability. Conclusions: In essence, the sequencing-based analysis of absolute bacterial diversity could not differentiate the farming systems based on the amount of diversity but identified a unique set of taxa defining each. Hence, pairing this evaluation with the qPCR-based functional gene analyses can be a suitable approach to distinguish the exerted effects of CA or OA on soils.

Most C estimation protocols utilize a default dead wood CF of 50\%, but live tree studies suggest this value is an over-estimate. Here, we compile and analyze a global database of dead wood CFs in trees, showing that dead wood CFs average 48.5\% across forests, deviating significantly from 50\%, and varying systematically among biomes, taxonomic divisions, tissue types, and decay classes. Utilizing data-driven dead wood CFs in tropical forests alone may correct systematic overestimates in dead wood C stocks of {\textasciitilde}3.0 Pg C: an estimate approaching nearly the entire dead wood C pool in the temperate forest biome. We provide for the first time, robust empirical dead wood CFs to inform global forest C estimation.},

  abstract = {Paddy rice fields are one of the most important sources of anthropogenic methane. Improving the accuracy in the CH4 budget is fundamental to identify strategies to mitigate climate change. Such improvement requires a mechanistic understanding of the complex interactions between environmental and agronomic factors determining CH4 emissions, and also the characterization of the annual temporal CH4 emissions pattern in the whole crop cycle. Hence, both the growing and fallow seasons must be included. However, most of the previous research has been based on single-factor analyses that are focused on the growing season. In order to fill this gap, a study was conducted in a Mediterranean rice agrosystem (Ebre Delta, Catalonia) following a farm-to-farm approach with the purpose of 1) evaluating the cumulative and temporal pattern of CH4 emission, and 2) conducting a multi-variate analyses to assess the associative pattern, relative contribution and temporal variation of the main explanatory variables concerning the observed CH4 emissions. Measurements of CH4 emissions and agronomic and environmental parameters in 15 commercial rice fields were monitored monthly, during a whole crop field cycle. The temporal pattern of CH4 emission followed a bi-modal distribution peaking in August and October. The cumulative annual CH4 emissions from rice fields amounted 314 kg CH4 kg ha-1, of which ca. 70\% were emitted during the fallow season. The main controlling factors of the CH4 emission rate in the growing season were positive related to water level and plant cover, while soil redox was negatively related. The main controlling factors in the fallow season were water level (negatively related, conversely to the growing season), as well as straw incorporation and soil temperature (positively related). The results of this study highlight the importance of the often neglected fallow season in the accurate estimation of CH4 emissions and, thus, the necessity of measurement programs that cover the whole crop field cycle. This information is the first step for setting effective mitigation strategies based on straw and water management.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Climate change would cause negative impacts on future agricultural production and food security. Adaptive measures should be taken to mitigate the adverse effects. The objectives of this study were to simulate the potential effects of climate change on maize yields in Heilongjiang Province and to evaluate two selected typical household-level autonomous adaptive measures (cultivar changes and planting time adjustments) for mitigating the risks of climate change based on the CERES-Maize model. RESULTS: The results showed that flowering duration and maturity duration of maize would be shortened in the future climate and thus maize yield would reduce by 11-46\% during 2011-2099 relative to 1981-2010. Increased CO2 concentration would not benefit maize production significantly. However, substituting local cultivars with later-maturing ones and delaying the planting date could increase yields as the climate changes. CONCLUSION: The results provide insight regarding the likely impacts of climate change on maize yields and the efficacy of selected adaptive measures by presenting evidence-based implications and mitigation strategies for the potential negative impacts of future climate change.},

  abstract = {Rice cultivation is a major source of methane (CH4) emissions. Intermittent irrigation systems in rice cultivation, such as the mid-season drainage (MSD), are effective strategies to mitigate CH4 emissions during the growing season, though the reduction rates are variable and dependent on the crop context. Aeration periods induce alteration of soil CH4 dynamics that can be prolonged after flooding recovery. However, whether these changes persist beyond the growing season remains underexplored. A field experiment was conducted in Spain to study the effect of MSD implemented during the rice growing season on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in relation to the standard permanently flooded water management (PFL). Specifically, the study aimed at (1) assessing the CH4 mitigation capacity of MSD in the studied area and (2) testing the hypothesis that the mitigating effect of MSD can be extended into the following winter flooded fallow season. Year-round GHG sampling was conducted, seasonal and annual cumulative emissions of CH4 and N2O as well as the global warming potential were calculated, and grain yield was measured. MSD reduced growing season CH4 emissions by ca. 80\% without yield penalties. During the flooded fallow season, MSD reduced CH4 emissions by ca. 60\%, despite both fields being permanently flooded. The novelty of our observations lies in the amplified mitigation capacity of MSD by extending the CH4 mitigation effect to the following flooded winter fallow season. This finding becomes especially relevant in rice systems with flooded winter fallow season given the large contribution of this season to the annual CH4 emissions.},

Identifying the main factors driving the assemblage structure of benthic macroinvertebrate is thus important for the development of management strategies in these ecosystems. However, studies on the drivers of macroinvertebrate assemblages are scarce in subtropical coastal lakes of the Neotropical region. Here, we evaluated the role of environmental (morphometric and water chemistry variables) and spatial factors in the assemblage structure of benthic macroinvertebrates in 36 coastal freshwater lakes in Brazil from 2008 to 2015. Macroinvertebrate family richness increased with ammonium, pH and water transparency, and decreased with nitrate content (slope {$\approx$}1 for all significant variables). Environmental factors explained most of the variation in macroinvertebrate composition (16\%) compared to spatial ones (3.4\%). In specific, Dugesiidae, Hydrobiidae, Corbiculidae, Sphaeromatidae, Noteridae, Hydropsychidae, Culicidae and Ceratopogonidae predominated in lakes with lower conductivity ({$<$}100 {$\mu$}S/cm) and higher water transparency ({$>$}1 m). Spatial factors summarized differences in macroinvertebrate assemblages between isolated and connected lakes. Although none of the lakes studied are directly impacted by organic pollution, our results suggest that benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages in subtropical coastal lakes are mostly structured by water chemistry, likely reflecting the major trends in land use along the study region (transition from agriculture to urban areas). We recommend that the conservation of macroinvertebrate biodiversity in southern Brazilian coastal lakes focus on the monitoring of water chemistry factors associated with human-based land use.},

  abstract = {Rice paddy fields are one of the largest anthropogenic sources of methane (CH4), the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) after carbon dioxide (CO2). For this reason most studies on the GHG budget in these agricultural systems focus on the evaluation of CH4 production. However, these systems also exchange other GHGs with the atmosphere, such as CO2 and nitrous oxide (N2O). To estimate the total global warming potential (GWP) of rice cultivation, a field experiment was carried out in a Mediterranean rice paddy field in the Po Valley (Italy), the largest rice producing region in Europe. For two consecutive years, ecosystem CO2 and CH4 fluxes were assessed using the eddy covariance technique and CH4 and N2O fluxes were measured with closed chambers. The net biome productivity indicated a nearly carbon (C) neutral system in 2009 while it accumulated C in 2010, due to the application of organic fertilizers and the midseason drainage of the otherwise flooded field, the latter having the additional benefit of leading to lower water consumption. The rice paddy field acted as a strong GHG source with a GWP of 1148 g CO2-eq m-2 yr-1 in 2009 and decreased four-fold in 2010 (289 g CO2-eq m-2 yr-1). In both years, the site was a large CH4 source. Differences in the GHG budget between the two years of measurements were mainly caused by the lower CH4 emissions in 2010 (21.0 g CH4 m-2 compared to 37.4 g CH4 m-2 in 2009), probably driven by drainage of the otherwise flooded field in the middle of the growing season during 2010 and moderately larger CO2 uptake. The increased N2O fluxes (29\%), had a marginal contribution to the GWP. However, midseason drainage, which needs to be evaluated in combination with the concurrent application of organic fertilizers, resulted in small decreases of yield. Our results therefore suggest that an adequate management of the water table level reduces CH4 fluxes and has the potential to decrease the GWP and water losses through evapotranspiration of rice paddy fields, confirming that full GHG budgets should be assessed in combination with yields in order to develop and evaluate effective mitigation strategies.},

These fluctuations affect soil water availability, a crucial driver of soil microbial activity. While these fluctuations are leaving imprints on soil microbiome structures, the question remains if the legacy of one type of weather fluctuation (e.g., drying-rewetting) affects the community response to the other (e.g., freezing-thawing). As both phenomenons give similar water availability fluctuations, we hypothesized that freezing-thawing and drying-rewetting cycles have similar effects on the soil microbiome. We tested this hypothesis by establishing targeted microcosm experiments. We created a legacy by exposing soil samples to a freezing-thawing or drying-rewetting cycle (phase 1), followed by an additional drying-rewetting or freezing-thawing cycle (phase 2). We measured soil respiration and analyzed soil microbiome structures. Across experiments, larger CO2 pulses and changes in microbiome structures were observed after rewetting than thawing. Drying-rewetting legacy affected the microbiome and CO2 emissions upon the following freezing-thawing cycle. Conversely, freezing-thawing legacy did not affect the microbial response to the drying-rewetting cycle. Our results suggest that drying-rewetting cycles have stronger effects on soil microbial communities and CO2 production than freezing-thawing cycles and that this pattern is mediated by sustained changes in soil microbiome structures.},

The study accounts for aboveground coarse woody debris including standing dead trees, lying deadwood, and naturally formed stumps. Basic mensurational information (diameter, height, decay class) about dead wood was collected in the field during the inventory of the forests of the nature reserve Babia hora. The data were used for the calculation of CWD timber volume. In the next step, CWD timber volume was converted to carbon stock using the carbon proportion of 50.1\% and density values of decay classes derived from the information published elsewhere. The analysis revealed that when CWD timber volume was converted to carbon stocks using the basic wood density of fresh wood, C stocks were overestimated by 40\% or more depending on the developmental stage and elevation. The results also revealed that as the elevation increases, CWD carbon stocks decrease and the differences between the developmental stages diminish.},

A better understanding of the biomass dynamics of forests is needed to clarify the role played by naturally developing forests in the mitigation of climate change.                                                     Long-term monitoring data from unmanaged strict forest reserves (SFRs) in north-western Germany were used to analyse the biomass dynamics of pure beech, mixed beech and mixed oak forests. A complete balance of above-ground woody biomass (biomass) and growth, density-dependent and -independent mortality, as well as deadwood decay was derived. Density-independent mortality served as a proxy for disturbance severity.                                                     After a time since abandonment (TSA) of 50~years, the average biomass ranged between 334~t/ha in mixed oak and 478~t/ha in pure beech stands. The net change in biomass was positive in all forest types. Density-independent mortality and decay rates were much lower than the growth rates. Pure beech forests reached higher levels of biomass, a higher net change in biomass, and more growth than either of the mixed forest types. Biomass increased linearly with TSA in pure beech stands but followed an asymptotic course in the mixed forests. In the latter, the net change in biomass and growth were consistent with a unimodal development pattern. The development of biomass could not be explained by the ageing of the tree communities.                                                                          Synthesis                     . We hypothesized that the observed biomass dynamics are a result of the interaction between resource supply within a limited growing space and the resource-use efficiency of the tree stand in conjunction with disturbances. The still-linear increase in the biomass of pure beech forests was assumed to reflect the high resource-use efficiency of beech, especially its use of light. The above-ground capacity of naturally developing broadleaved forests to store and acquire carbon is substantial. Accordingly, allowing broadleaved forests to develop naturally can contribute substantially to carbon storage and sequestration. However, our study also suggests that the above-ground carbon sink decreases after several decades.                                                                           ,              Zusammenfassung                                                                {\"U}ber das Potenzial von W{\"a}ldern mit nat{\"u}rlicher Entwicklung als Senke und Speicher f{\"u}r Kohlenstoff wird intensiv diskutiert.

  abstract = {Wetland ecosystems provide an optimum natural environment for the sequestration and long-term storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, yet are natural sources of greenhouse gases emissions, especially methane. We illustrate that most wetlands, when carbon sequestration is compared to methane emissions, do not have 25 times more CO2 sequestration than methane emissions; therefore, to many landscape managers and non specialists, most wetlands would be considered by some to be sources of climate warming or net radiative forcing. We show by dynamic modeling of carbon flux results from seven detailed studies by us of temperate and tropical wetlands and from 14 other wetland studies by others that methane emissions become unimportant within 300 years compared to carbon sequestration in wetlands. Within that time frame or less, most wetlands become both net carbon and radiative sinks. Furthermore, we estimate that the world's wetlands, despite being only about 5-8 \% of the terrestrial landscape, may currently be net carbon sinks of about 830 Tg/year of carbon with an average of 118 g-C m-2 year-1 of net carbon retention. Most of that carbon retention occurs in tropical/subtropical wetlands. We demonstrate that almost all wetlands are net radiative sinks when balancing carbon sequestration and methane emissions and conclude that wetlands can be created and restored to provide C sequestration and other ecosystem services without great concern of creating net radiative sources on the climate due to methane emissions. {\copyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

  abstract = {This paper summarizes 19 papers published in a special issue of Ecological Engineering under the general banner of wetlands and carbon. Many of the papers were presented at a special session at EcoSummit 2016 in Montpellier, France in August-September 2016. The papers are in four general categories: estimating greenhouse gas fluxes with eddy covariance; methane and other greenhouse gas emissions from wetlands; carbon sequestration by wetlands; and organic carbon decomposition in wetlands. Overall, we found that further development and wider use of eddy covariance measuring stations could help clarify long-term annual budgets of CO2 and CH4 in wetlands and, while CH4 fluxes in some coastal wetlands such as mangroves can be negligible, some inland wetlands can be significant sources of CH4 where hydroperiods are the major determinants of the emission rates. The papers here demonstrated a variety of parameters determining dynamics of methane fluxes and carbon sequestration in different wetlands and lead us to suggest that more attention should be paid to detailed analysis of the impact of environmental and management factors on carbon budgets in wetlands. Carbon sequestration is almost always estimated by soil dating methods such as with 137Cs and 210Pb isotopes and results continue to show order of magnitude differences among systems but sometimes among laboratories. This is due to the inexact nature of estimating soil dates over relatively short ({$\sim$}50 year) time horizons. The idea of capping landfills, which are enormous methane sources, with wetlands which could then turn them into carbon sinks is worth investigating further but the design of these systems is still in its infancy. Organic carbon decomposition in wetlands has been investigated extensively for decades and more recently on the biogeochemical processes. `Enzymic latches'' such as phenol oxidase, which can break down phenolics and therefore speed up decomposition, may be key controllers of organic matter decomposition in waterlogged and submerged soils in wetlands. The best approach for balancing greenhouse gases and carbon sequestration remains an enigma, but the papers in this special issue take us one step closer to providing clarity.},

  abstract = {To assess the role of floodwater in controlling the exchanges of CO2 and CH4 from soil, floodwater and the canopy in intermittently flooded rice paddies, an intensive field campaign (IREX96) was conducted in Japan during August 1996. Eddy covariance was employed to measure fluxes of heat, water vapor and CO2. The flux-gradient method was used to determine CH4 fluxes from measured profiles of CH4 concentrations, with the required eddy diffusivity estimated using a modified aerodynamic approach or CO2 as a reference scalar. When the paddy was drained, net CO2 uptake from the atmosphere during daytime was 23\% less, and nighttime CO2 emissions were almost twice as great, than when the paddy was flooded. The mean daily CO2 uptake on the drained days was 14.5 g m-2, {\textbackslash}textless50\% of the mean for the flooded days. These differences in the CO2 budget were mainly due to increased CO2 emissions from the soil surface under drained conditions resulting from the removal of the diffusion barrier caused by the floodwater. Small changes in canopy photosynthesis observed between flooded and drained paddies had little influence on the CO2 budget and could be explained by sensitivity of stomata to humidity saturation deficit. The CH4 flux for the drained paddy showed distinct diurnal variation with a maximum of {$\sim$}1.3 {$\mu$}g CH4 m-2 s-1 in the afternoon, but after reflooding the peak flux decreased to {\textbackslash}textless0.9 {$\mu$}g CH4 m-2 s-1. Mean daily CH4 emissions were 28\% larger for the drained paddy than when it was flooded. As with the CO2 flux, the larger CH4 flux on the drained days can be attributed to reduced resistance of CH4 transfer from the soil to air by removal of the floodwater.

With the onset of intermittent irrigation, larval mosquito (Culex tritaeniorhynchus Giles and Anopheles sinensis Wiedemann) abundance decreased; reirrigated fields were colonized initially by first instars. Abundance of aquatic arthropod predators and larvivorous fish also decreased drastically. Water from irrigation canals was considered to be a major source of recolonization by these predators with limited breeding seasons and longer developmental periods than mosquitoes. Richness (number of taxa) of aquatic insect communities decreased, but the percentage mosquitoes among insects increased with repeated intermittent irrigation.

  abstract = {Deltaic wetlands are highly productive ecosystems, which characteristically can act as C-sinks. However, they are among the most threatened ecosystems, being very vulnerable to global change, and require special attention towards its conservation. Knowing their climate change mitigating potential, conservation measures should also be oriented with a climatic approach, to strengthen their regulatory services. In this work we studied the carbon biogeochemistry and the specific relevance of certain microbial guilds on carbon metabolisms of the three main types of deltaic wetlands located in the Ebro Delta, north-eastern Spain, as well as how they deal with human pressures and climate change effects. We estimated the metabolic rates of the main carbon-related metabolisms (primary production and respiration) and the resulting carbon and global warming potential balances in sites with a different salinity range and trophic status. With the results obtained, we tried to define the influence of possible changes in salinity and trophic level linked to the main impacts currently threatening deltaic wetlands, on the C-metabolisms and GHG emissions, for a better understanding of the mitigating capacity and their possible enhancement when applying specific management actions. Metabolic rates showed a pattern highly influenced by the salinity range and nutrients inputs. Freshwater and brackish wetlands, with higher nutrient inputs from agricultural runoff, showed higher C-capture capacity (around 220--250 g C m-2 y-1), but also higher rates of degradative metabolisms (aerobic respiration and CH4 emissions). Contrastingly, the rates of C-related metabolisms and C-retention of Salicornia-type coastal salt marshes were lower (42 g C m-2 y-1). The study of the microbial metacommunity composition by the16S RNA gene sequencing revealed a significant higher presence of methanogens in the salt marsh, and also higher metabolic potential, where there was significantly more organic matter content in sediment. Salinity inhibition, however, explained the lower respiration rates, both aerobic and anaerobic, and prevented higher rates of methanogenesis despite the major presence of methanogens. Conservation measures for these wetlands would require, overall, maintaining the sediment contributions of the river basin intending to overcome the regression of the Delta and its salt marshes in a climate change scenario. Particularly, for reducing degradative metabolisms, and favour C-retention, nutrient inputs should be controlled in freshwater and brackish wetlands in order to reduce eutrophication. In salt marshes, the reduction of salinity should be avoided to control increases in methanogenesis and CH4 emissions.},

Despite this, the mechanisms determining the response of heterotrophic soil respiration to soil moisture remain poorly quantified, being represented in most current carbon cycle models as simple empirical functions. With the aim of providing an overview and new insights into the mechanisms involved, here we review the observations and theory behind the respiration-moisture relationship. We start by calculating best estimates of average empirical relationships using published data and comparing the results for contrasting soil types. The theoretical linkages between substrate and gas diffusivity in soil pores and heterotrophic respiration are then explored as a function of temperature and textural properties. Based on this theoretical model we interpret the variability of moisture effects observed in previous empirical studies. Transient CO2 effluxemoisture relationships are discussed next, reviewing the theory and models developed in the last years with particular emphasis on the `Birch effect'. We continue by giving an overview of recent pore-scale models and consider how these can be used to gain a more mechanistic understanding of carbon storage and stabilization in variably saturated soils. From this review we conclude that current empirical models are useful but limited approximations, with questionable predictive capacity. Significant efforts are still necessary to represent the full range of soil moisture responses in a unifying model with a sound theoretical basis that can help identify common underlying processes. Equations present here, combining diffusion, texture and substrate to model respiration, are a step forward in this direction.},

In addition, use of wood density, volume and mass loss to quantitatively describe the degree of decay was tested. The mass loss during decay could be described by a simple exponential function. Under the presented climatic conditions, beech coarse woody debris (CWD) with a diameter {\textbackslash}textgreater10 cm decays completely in about 35 years. In the first 8 years of decay the mass loss is determined by the decrease in wood density, and subsequently by the loss in volume. Estimation of wood density allows the first three of the four classes of decay to be distinguished, while trees in the last two decay classes could be distinguished using wood volume. Beech fine woody debris with a diameter between 1 and 10 cm decays within about 18 years. The litter fraction of {\textbackslash}textless1 cm is part of the humus layer after 4 years. If there are goals for the amounts, types and dimensions of woody debris to be provided for conservation of biological biodiversity and other ecological functions in managed beech forests, this study offer indications for how long existing woody debris can meet its functions and how frequent new input of CWD is required. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag 2009.},

We quantified the gap disturbance regime in an old-growth forest dominated by European beech ( Fagus sylvatica L.) and silver fir ( Abies alba Miller) in the Dinaric Mountains of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We sampled 87 gaps in four stands using line-intercept sampling. The percentages of forest area in canopy gaps and expanded gaps ranged from 12\% to 17.2\% and 35.5\% to 39.7\%, respectively. Although many of the gaps were small ({$<$}100~m               2               ) and formed from a single gapmaker, large canopy openings~{$>$}1000~m               2               with numerous gapmakers made up a disproportionate amount of the total gap area. More than half the gaps had more than one gapmaker and were often in separate decay classes, indicating gaps had expanded over time during separate disturbance events. Furthermore, 51\% of all gapmakers were uprooted or wind-snapped, whereas only 22\% died standing. These results suggest that wind disturbance plays an important role in creating intermediate to large canopy openings through both gap formation and gap expansion processes.},

  abstract = {As water becomes scarcer in rice (Oryza sativa L.) production regions throughout the world, producers are becoming aware of the importance of increasing water use efficiency. Thus, new rice production methods which increase water use efficiency (WUE) are beginning to be adopted. This is study analyzes one such alternative production method and its economic feasibility in Arkansas. Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation has the potential to address the concerns of groundwater depletion as well as greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) associated with rice production. Field experiments were conducted in 2012 and 2013 in the Arkansas Delta for three different AWD irrigation regimes and compared to continuous flooded rice. Data collection included CH4 and N2O emissions, grain yields, and irrigation total water use. Relative to continuous flooding WUE increased by 21 to 56\% with the adoption of AWD irrigation and global warming potential (GWP) decreased by 45 to 90\%. One common criticism of AWD is the potential for reduced yields and subsequent reductions in producer profits. Our results indicate that some AWD regimes are currently economically competitive even without incentives such as GHG reduction payments or water conservation payments. These results suggest that there is currently an economic rationale for adoption of some AWD regimes and those AWD regimes that are not currently economically competitive may be in the future as groundwater levels recede. A county-level break-even analysis indicates an additional depth to ground water of only 5 to 10 m will result in other AWD practices evaluated here becoming profitable.},

  abstract = {Recent research suggests that groundwater overdraft can be mitigated by application of water onto agricultural lands for direct groundwater recharge. This technique is often called Agricultural Managed Aquifer Recharge (Ag-MAR) and is carried out in wintertime. Winter flooding of rice paddies could be considered as a form of Ag-MAR. Currently, it is implemented in Europe as an environmentally friendly practice, which could also bring many agronomic and hydrological benefits; however, especially the latter aspects have been poorly investigated in the past. Results of a hydrological study focused on winter flooding in three rice areas in northern Italy and lasting 18 months (winter seasons 2017--2018 and 2018--2019, and summer season 2018) are presented in this paper. The objective of winter flooding was to maintain higher groundwater levels till the beginning of the agricultural season in order to increase rice irrigation efficiency and protect some groundwater dependent ecosystems. Main findings are: (1) the percolation efficiency of winter flooding is very high (92--97\% of the water volume applied on the fields); (2) local groundwater levels underneath the recharge areas increase at a similar rate as during the summer flooding and reach peak values that are close; (3) however, the rate of level decrease after the end of the flooding period is much faster with the winter flooding, when pre-flooding groundwater levels are re-established in 1 month, in contrast with at least 2 months with the summer flooding: this is due to the fact that the areas adopting winter flooding are less extended and more fragmented than the ones flooded during the agricultural season; (4) consequently, to maintain higher groundwater levels until the beginning of the cropping season, winter flooding should last longer and involve larger areas.},

These data were used to develop biomass equations that are based on an allometric relationship. The models for conif erous trees provide an estimate of dry branch and needle mass (DBNM). In contrast, the models for broadleaved trees give an estimate of dry branch mass without leaves (DBM). The results show that DBH, crown ratio CR (CU total height), and crown width ratio CWR (CW/CL) are the most important independent variables to estimate DBM and DBNM, respectively. Crown par ameters are particularly important, if the data come from a specific tree population (e.g. thinning material comprising mainly suppressed trees). Thus, by including crown parameters into the models, the range of applica bility of the models can be extended.},

  abstract = {National and international carbon reporting systems require information on carbon stocks of forests. For this purpose, terrestrial assessment systems such as forest inventory data in combination with carbon estimation methods are often used. In this study we analyze and compare terrestrial carbon estimation methods from 12 European countries. The country-specific methods are applied to five European tree species (Fagus sylvatica L., Quercus robur L., Betula pendula Roth, Picea abies (L.) Karst. and Pinus sylvestris L.), using a standardized theoretically-generated tree dataset. We avoid any bias due to data collection and/or sample design by using this approach. We are then able to demonstrate the conceptual differences in the resulting carbon estimates with regard to the applied country-specific method. In our study we analyze (i) allometric biomass functions, (ii) biomass expansion factors in combination with volume functions and (iii) a combination of both. The results of the analysis show discrepancies in the resulting estimates for total tree carbon and for single tree compartments across the countries analyzed of up to 140 t carbon/ha. After grouping the country-specific approaches by European Forest regions, the deviation within the results in each region is smaller but still remains. This indicates that part of the observed differences can be attributed to varying growing conditions and tree properties throughout Europe. However, the large remaining error is caused by differences in the conceptual approach, different tree allometry, the sample material used for developing the biomass estimation models and the definition of the tree compartments. These issues are currently not addressed and require consideration for reliable and consistent carbon estimates throughout Europe.},

Many countries rich in forest resources - including Australia - utilize those resources only sparingly owing to poor understanding of their sustainability. Semi-arid woodlands dominated by Callitris and Eucalyptus spp. are common in inland Australia but are slow growing. There is little published information on wood properties (including basic density, carbon concentration, energy) for this forest type. We estimated the carbon and energy stocks of mixed Callitris stands in central-eastern Australia, linking laboratory analysis with field sampling and surveys. Wood density of Callitris spp. was 30\% less than that of admixed Eucalyptus spp. Carbon and energy densities of Callitris spp. were also less than admixed species, albeit with reduced variation. While Eucalyptus spp. constitute about 40\% of the growing stock, and have mostly larger dimensions, they are not generally harvested due to regulatory constraints and limited markets for their wood products. Based on conservative rates of growth, harvested biomass would provide {\textasciitilde}4000 kWh ha 1 year 1. If used with cogeneration technology, biomass fuel could assist in balancing seasonal energy demands, especially for heating and cooling. While slow-growing, Callitris-Eucalyptus forests share many features with other economically relevant species and forests worldwide. Quantification of potential bioenergy is a crucial first step in optimizing forest management and addressing the market constraints and infrastructure needs of any potential biofuel project.},

This carrying capacity determines the potential carbon sequestration in live trees and the maximum growing stock. Lower stocking through thinning can change growth and mortality. We were interested in the relations between stand structure, increment, and mortality using a long-unmanaged oak-hornbeam forest near Vienna, Austria, as a case study. We expected lower increment for heavily thinned compared to unmanaged stands. We tested the thinning response using three permanent growth plots, in which two were thinned (50\% and 70\% basal area removed) and one remained unmanaged. We calculated stand structure (basal area, stem density, diameter distribution) and increment and mortality of single trees. Over ten years, the heavily thinned stand had a similar increment as that of the moderately thinned and unthinned stands. The basal area of the unthinned stand remained constant and stem density decreased due to competition-related mortality. The studied oak-hornbeam stands responded well even to late and heavy thinning, suggesting a broad ``plateau'' of stocking and increment for these forest types. Lower stem density for thinned stands led to a much larger tree increment of single trees, compared to the unthinned reference. The findings of this study need verification for other soil and climatic conditions.},

I combine two different modelling paradigms to predict the separate and combined (additive) effects of climate and land-use change on terrestrial vertebrate communities under four different scenarios. I predict that climate-change effects are likely to become a major pressure on biodiversity in the coming decades, probably matching or exceeding the effects of land-use change by 2070. The combined effects of both pressures are predicted to lead to an average cumulative loss of 37.9\% of species from vertebrate communities under `business as usual' (uncertainty ranging from 15.7\% to 54.2\%). Areas that are predicted to experience the effects of both pressures are concentrated in tropical grasslands and savannahs. The results have important implications for the conservation of biodiversity in future, and for the ability of biodiversity to support important ecosystem functions, upon which humans rely.},

  abstract = {Dead wood is essential for biodiversity in forests and is therefore often surveyed in conservation inventories. Usually only coarse downed trees (logs) and standing dead trees (snags) are surveyed, but dead wood also occurs on living trees, in stumps, and in fallen branches. Attached, standing (including stumps) and downed dead wood with a diameter of more than 1 cm was surveyed in 25 semi-natural stands of temperate broadleaved woodland dominated by oak in southern Sweden (most trees younger than 70 years but with an older generation of Quercus, and often Corylus scrub). This study is primarily motivated by the rising interest in biofuel harvesting by thinning which will affect dead wood structure in forests, especially the finer dead wood fractions. The sites in this study contained on average 14.3 m3/ha coarse dead wood (defined as wood with a diameter {$>$}10 cm), which is more than twice as much as in production woodland. Fine dead wood (diameter 1--10 cm) made up another 12.2 m3/ha (45\% of the total dead wood volume). Of the fine dead wood, on average 20\% was oak wood and 71\% was wood from other broadleaved trees. The coarse dead wood fraction consisted equally of oak wood (46\%) and wood from other broadleaved species (47\%). Coniferous wood amounted to 7\% (coarse dead wood) or 8\% (fine dead wood). The total dead wood volume was dominated by downed (66\%) and standing dead wood (22\%), while attached dead wood and stumps amounted to smaller fractions (6\% each). The total volume of fine dead wood did not correlate with the total volume of coarse dead wood. These results therefore suggest that fine dead wood cannot be predicted from conservation surveys of coarse dead wood. The value for biodiversity of fine dead wood is discussed, and should not be overlooked in conservation work due to the fact that for example, many fungi and insects are associated with it.},

We used seven experimental sites from two continents (North America and Australia) to evaluate the impacts of imposed extreme drought on the abundance, community composition, richness, and function of soil bacterial and fungal communities. The sites encompassed different grassland ecosystems spanning a wide range of climatic and soil properties. Drought significantly altered the community composition of soil bacteria and, to a lesser extent, fungi in grasslands from two continents. The magnitude of the fungal community change was directly proportional to the precipitation gradient. This greater fungal sensitivity to drought at more mesic sites contrasts with the generally observed pattern of greater drought sensitivity of plant communities in more arid grasslands, suggesting that plant and microbial communities may respond differently along precipitation gradients. Actinobateria, and Chloroflexi, bacterial phyla typically dominant in dry environments, increased their relative abundance in response to drought, whereas Glomeromycetes, a fungal class regarded as widely symbiotic, decreased in relative abundance. The response of Chlamydiae and Tenericutes, two phyla of mostly pathogenic species, decreased and increased along the precipitation gradient, respectively. Soil enzyme activity consistently increased under drought, a response that was attributed to drought-induced changes in microbial community structure rather than to changes in abundance and diversity. Our results provide evidence that drought has a widespread effect on the assembly of microbial communities, one of the major drivers of soil function in terrestrial ecosystems. Such responses may have important implications for the provision of key ecosystem services, including nutrient cycling, and may result in the weakening of plant--microbial interactions and a greater incidence of certain soil-borne diseases.},

Both forest management and conservation are increasingly focusing on the integration of deadwood into forest management. Deadwood volume and composition are driven by forest type, stand age, natural tree mortality, tree species composition and harvesting intensity. Here, we used inventory data from 28 unmanaged natural forest reserves (NFR) in Austria to analyse the patterns and drivers of: (i) the volume of standing and lying deadwood, (ii) the diversity of deadwood in different forest types. Eight forest types are located in the investigated NFRs covering a wide range of vegetation types with altitudes of 140--1825 m asl. The volumes of living wood and deadwood differed markedly between forest types. The average deadwood volume per forest type ranged from 23 m3 ha-1 in larch forests to 109 m3 ha-1 in spruce-fir-beech forests. Likewise, deadwood diversity (species diversity as well as diversity in diameter classes and degree of decomposition) differed significantly among forest types, with the highest deadwood diversity found in beech and spruce forests and the lowest in hardwood floodplain forests, carbonate pine forests and larch forests. Our results show that volume and composition of deadwood vary greatly among different forest types. Regression models revealed that the availability of deadwood was mainly driven by tree- and stand related factors (e.g. forest type, diameter at breast height and volume of living stand), whereas site-related (e.g. altitude) and climatic factors (e.g. mean annual precipitation) had a minor influence. The variables tree species diversity, aspect and slope showed no significance and were therefore not integrated into the final model. This study provides insights into deadwood availability and diversity in NFRs on a national scale, providing reference data for unmanaged temperate forests and aiding decision-making in nature conservation and forest management, since NFRs are reference areas for close-to-nature forestry.},

  abstract = {The paddy field is being recognised as a biodiversity hotspot fostering a variety of organisms. However, there are few studies on the ecology of paddy field nematodes. We characterised nematode communities in rice paddy fields by comparing them with upland fields of rice or soybean. We examined nematode communities of the top (0e15 mm) and second (15e50 mm) soil layers before flooding (March or April), during flooding (June or July) and during the draining period (October) 2007e2009. We found that the nematode community in the paddy was different than that in the upland fields during all periods. Rhabdolaimus, Tobrilus, Mesodorylaims and Monhysteridae characterised the top of the paddy and Hirschmanniella characterised the second layer of the paddy. Total nematode density was generally lower in the paddy than in the upland field. However, the density in the paddy top layer increased with time from the flooding period to the draining period, during which time it was about the same as (or even greater than) the peak density in the upland fields. The density in the second layer of the paddy remained lower than that in the top layer of the paddy throughout the time course. Community diversity values were generally greater in the paddy top layer than in the paddy second layer across the six sampling periods, but periodic differences between the paddy and upland fields or between soil layers were not significant. During the flooding period, the F/(F {\th} B) (13e37) and Enrichment Index (17e38) values were lower in the paddy than in the upland fields (32e47, 37e74, respectively) to reflect that bacteria dominate over fungi with slow decomposition due to anaerobic conditions in the flooded paddy field. In addition, particularly in the top layer, the Maturity (2.0e2.4) and Structure Index (23e72) values were greater in the paddy than in the upland fields (1.7e2.1, 9e15, respectively), indicating a welldeveloped ecosystem under water. These unique nematode communities persisted during the draining period, but there was a rapid increase in opportunistic bacterivores, which increased the EI values. We suggest that bactivorous nematodes in the families Cephalobidae and Chronogasteridae, herbivores in the genus Hirschmanniella, and fungivores in the genus Filenchus may be specific to paddy field soil rather than to pond and lake sediments.},

In Ireland, managed Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong) Carr.) forests account for 52.3\% of the total forest estate. To determine the stock and decay dynamics of above and belowground CWD, field surveys using fixed area sample plots, were conducted in six even-aged Sitka spruce stands, representing the young, intermediate and mature stages of a typical commercial rotation. The volume, mass, density loss and C:N ratio of all CWD types (logs, stumps, and coarse roots) were determined using a five-decay class (DC) system. The decay rates and half life of CWD was also determined. To estimate CWD coarse root mass; roots associated with stumps classified in different decay classes were excavated. The coarse roots were categorised into small (2-10. mm), medium (10-50. mm) and large ({\textbackslash}textgreater50. mm) diameter classes.CWD C-mass ranged from 6.98 to 18.62Mgha-1 and was highest in an intermediate forest (D35), while the aboveground volume varied from 6.31 to 42.27m3ha-1. Coarse roots accounted for 21\% to 85\% of the total CWD C-pool in the surveyed stands. The total CWD C-mass was poorly correlated with the number of thinning events (R2=0.29), when data from D35 was excluded. The density loss was significant in logs (45\%), stumps (58\%), and small- (38\%), medium- (50\%) and large roots (38\%) as decay progress from DC 0 to 4. There was a 46\%, 41\%, 51\%, 72\% and 57\% decline in C:N ratio of logs, stumps, small-, medium- and large roots, respectively, as decay progressed from DC 0 to 4. The density decay rates were 0.059, 0.048 and 0.036kgm-3year-1 for logs, stumps and coarse roots, respectively. The size classification of roots did not significantly affect their decay rate. The half life (50\% decomposition) of CWD was estimated has 12-, 14- and 19years for logs, stumps and roots of Sitka spruce. Regression curves showed a strong correlation between the density and C:N ratio (R2=0.69, 0.74 and 0.93 for logs, stumps and coarse roots, respectively). The long term storage of C and its slow rate of decomposition make CWD a vital structural and functional component of the CWD C-pool and a major controller of forest ecosystem C-retention. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Further intensification and expansion of agricultural lands would be of major concern for the environment and biodiversity. There is, therefore, a need to understand better the impacts on biodiversity from the global food system. Since biodiversity underpins functions and services that are essential to agriculture, greater consideration of the role of biodiversity in the food system is needed. Here we have generated a conceptual framework separating the environment-agriculture-trade system into its key components, revealing complex interactions and highlighting the role of biodiversity. This process identified components that are well studied, and gaps preventing a better understanding of the interactions, trade-offs, and synergies between biodiversity, agriculture, climate change, and international trade. We highlight eight priorities that will promote a greater understanding of the complexities of the environment-agriculture-trade system.},

An online survey was designed using Google Maps API, HTML, and JAVASCRIPT.

In total we collected 209 valid surveys and mapped 2617 georeferenced opinions. Facilities and services were rated highly by users (72.46\% were ``very satisfied''). These were followed by accessibility (61\%, ``very satisfied'') and signposting (60.2\%, ``satisfied'' or ``quite satisfied''). Safety and security items were hardly rated perhaps because users do not feel insecure in the area. Respondents' mapping of opinions and experiences, which are heterogeneous and were well rated, enabled us to visualize areas that might be understood as social hotspots. Our results show that PPGIS is an effective procedure for measuring public use in protected areas and may be a valuable tool for park managers and planners.},

A wide range of plants and animals is strongly associated with standing and lying deadwood. Deadwood is also a fundamental component of nutrient cycles, regulates water flows, prevents soil erosion and contributes to carbon storage in the forest. In consideration of this last aspect a method is proposed to sample and analyse wood density in deadwood (standing and lying) at different rates of decay. The wood density provides valuable information needed to calculate carbon content of the deadwood. The method has been applied on seven alpine forest species (fir, spruce, Swiss pine, black European pine, Scots pine, European larch and beech) localized in several valleys of Trentino province in north-east Italy. Laboratory analysis of the sample deadwood determined the moisture content, fresh density and dry density. Moisture content was significantly higher in logs than in snags; moreover, this value decreased from the first to the third decay class and thereafter increased from the third to the fifth class. The dry density decreased at a constant rate from lower to higher decay classes. For all species the maximum percentage of dry density reduction is found between the fourth and the fifth decay classes. This study provides a preliminary data set on deadwood density, above all taking into account the increasing importance of the carbon content closely connected with this attribute. {\copyright} 2010 Taylor \& Francis.},

Since litter traits relate to soil functions and organisms (i.e., litter decomposition and soil decomposer communities), in this study we explore if domestication-induced changes in litter quality have affected their decomposability, and bacterial, fungal, and nematode communities in the soil. Methods: We collected leaf litter from herbaceous crops and their wild progenitors, and measured litter chemical and physical traits. Then, we performed a litter decomposition assay on a common soil. After three months of litter incubation, we measured mass loss, nematode richness and community composition in ten crops. We also measured soil bacterial and fungal richness and community composition in six crops. Results: Domesticated litters had less carbon (C) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC), which accelerated decomposition in comparison to wild litters. Fungal richness was higher in microcosms incubated with domesticated litters, while the effects of domestication on bacterial richness differed among crops. Domestication did not affect nematode richness. The effects of domestication on bacterial and fungal community compositions differed among crops. Soils with domesticated litters tended to have nematode communities with a higher abundance of bacterial feeding nematodes, in comparison to soils fed with wild litters. Conclusion: Domestication altered decomposition at different levels. Leaf litter decomposability increased with domestication, which might alter resource inputs into the soil. Feeding soils with domesticated litters had idiosyncratic effects on soil microbes, but consistent effects on soil nematodes. Overall, domestication altered the linkages between crop residues and soil communities differently for bacteria, fungi, and nematodes.},

A field experiment was therefore conducted in farmers' field in Hanoi, Vietnam to examine whether the use of straw compost or straw biochar, in combination with the safe alternate wetting and drying (AWD) has the potential to suppress both CH4 and N2O emissions from rice paddies while maintaining the rice yield. The study compared the proposed strategies with local farmers' practice of permanent flooding (PF) and farmyard manure (FYM) incorporation, respectively. A control treatment without organic matter incorporation in both AWD and PF water regimes was also included in the study; all treatments received equal amounts of mineral fertilizer. Gas emissions were monitored using the closed chamber method at seven-day intervals during the first 50 days and at 15-day intervals thereafter. Addition of FYM, straw compost and biochar increased CH4 emissions by 230\%, 150\% and 38\%, respectively, when compared with the control treatments in both the AWD and PF water regimes. Within AWD, FYM increased N2O emissions by 30\%, straw compost and biochar displayed similar amount of N2O emissions as the control treatment. Within PF, N2O emissions under FYM and straw compost were 40\% and 35\% higher than the control treatment, respectively, and biochar once again displayed similar amount of N2O emissions as the control treatment. Yield difference was not significant (p {$>$} 0.05) between any of the treatments. These results indicated that the straw compost incorporation might not reduce the global warming potential (GWP) and yield-scaled GWP of rice production, whereas biochar in combination with AWD has the potential to maintain the GWP and yield-scaled GWP of rice production at lower level than the farmers' practice.},

As the study of ecosystem functioning expands to include more locations, time spans, and functions, the functional importance of individual species is becoming more apparent. However, the functional importance of individual species does not necessarily translate to the functional importance of biodiversity measured in whole communities of interacting species. Furthermore, ecological diversity at scales larger than neighborhood species richness could also influence the provision of multiple functions over extended time scales. We created experimental landscapes based on whole communities from the world's longest running biodiversity-functioning field experiment to investigate how local species richness ({$\alpha$} diversity), distinctness among communities ({$\beta$} diversity), and larger scale species richness ({$\gamma$} diversity) affected eight ecosystem functions over 10 y. Using both threshold-based and unique multifunctionality metrics, we found that {$\alpha$} diversity had strong positive effects on most individual functions and multifunctionality, and that positive effects of {$\beta$} and {$\gamma$} diversity emerged only when multiple functions were considered simultaneously. Higher {$\beta$} diversity also reduced the variability in multifunctionality. Thus, in addition to conserving important species, maintaining ecosystem multifunctionality will require diverse landscape mosaics of diverse communities.},

  abstract = {Climate change is increasing temperatures globally and drought in many regions. If climate change continues at its current rate, the resilience of many ecosystems will likely be exceeded, altering their structure and function. A consistent understanding of the impacts, however, remains elusive due to the difficulty of obtaining data of field studies at different scales from local to regional. We review the impacts of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems of the Mediterranean region based mostly on long-term field experiments of climatic manipulation and monitored field sites in Catalonia (NE Spain). These studies provide diverse experimental and observational field evidences that rising temperatures, new patterns of precipitation and other climatic changes are already affecting ecosystems in this Mediterranean region. Rapid genetic, epigenetic and metabolomics changes in plants have been described. They have resulted in changes in morphology, physiology, growth, reproduction, and mortality. Some species are more vulnerable to these changes than others are, which has altered their competitive ability and thereby changed microbial, plant and animal community composition. Many other impacts have been observed in response to climate change, for example an increase in the emission of biogenic volatile organic compounds or an increased risk of fire and a decrease in the absorption of CO2 in periods of drought. A reduction of the capacity to retain nutrients and C in vegetation is accompanied, in the short term, by an increase in soil C and nutrient contents due to a decrease in the enzymatic capacity and mineralization of soil. The projected increase of torrential rainfalls introduces a scenario of uncertain changes in nutrient cycles, soil fertility and nutrient fluxes at medium and long terms. All these changes in water and nutrient availability suggest, though, net losses in the capacity of Mediterranean forests and shrublands to act as C sinks. Future research should quantify C in above- and belowground biomasses and soils under drought and warming, because this necessary information is lacking. Future studies should also investigate the losses of soil nutrients by leaching and erosion, and the possible feedbacks of land cover changes on water availability and regional climate. Policies of environmental and forestry management should take into account these impacts of the environmental and climatic conditions projected for the coming years and decades.},

  abstract = {Global change is eroding freshwater biodiversity at higher rates than in any other ecosystem, potentially entailing a parallel degradation of ecosystem functions such as the predation function. However, the relationships between biodiversity and predation effectiveness remain poorly explored in freshwater ecosystems, largely due to the unavailability of easy-to-apply methods that allow to characterize the predation function under real-field conditions. Here we proposed the chironomid sentinel cards as a fast, reliable, and standardized method to estimate predation rates in aquatic ecosystems. Briefly, by easily gluing a set of commercially available chironomid larvae to a plastic card and offering them to aquatic predators during a timelapse we can quantify removal rates, and hence the predation function. As an indicator of the usefulness of the method, we additionally assessed whether the use of chironomid sentinel cards allows to link the estimated predation rates to three descriptors of predator assemblages: i ) taxa richness, ii ) Hill evenness, and iii ) abundance of aquatic predators. To do that, we combined a thorough sampling of aquatic macroinvertebrate predators with a large deployment of chironomid sentinel cards across 12 flooded rice fields during three different stages of the rice phenological cycle. Our results show that the three biodiversity indexes were positively related to the predation rate estimates, highlighting the sensibility of the method to changes in predator assemblages. We therefore conclude that the methodology is suitable to assess potential biodiversity-predation links under field aquatic conditions. We advocate to use the chironomid sentinel cards as an easy-to-apply, fast, and standardized method that allows comparisons of predation effectiveness across different shallow freshwater ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Ecological restoration of non-productive agricultural areas such as field margins has been identified as a key priority to enhance biodiversity and promote multiple ecosystem services within agroecosystems. Field margin restoration is especially important in rice (Oryza sativa, L), a globally important crop which occupies around 15 \% of world cropland surface. Even though assessment of how ecosystem service multifunctionality varies across different restoration strategies is scarce. Here, by using a 3-year field scale experiment, we evaluated how different restoration strategies (i.e., hedgerows, flower strips and passive restoration) contribute to ecosystem service multifunctionality in rice farming. We focused on the simultaneous provision of biodiversity enhancement, pest and weed control, mitigation of invasive species impact, and soil protection. We found that all restoration strategies substantially increased multifunctionality when compared to non-restored margins, with improved plant and natural enemy diversity, reduced weed abundance, enhanced protection against the invasive red swamp crawfish, and decreased soil erosion. Multifunctionality was similar across restoration strategies, yet the passive spontaneous restoration emerged as the most economically feasible. Overall, our results underscore the value of restoring non-productive areas such as field margins to promote rice multifunctional landscapes. Specifically, passive restoration strategies offer a promising approach to enhance multiple ecosystem services while remaining cost-effective, supporting both biodiversity conservation and sustainable agricultural production.},

In particular, waterfowl sometimes rely on ricefields as nocturnal foraging habitat during winter if post-harvest practices make food accessible. To assess whether the winter flooding of ricefields could be a major driver of duck regional abundance in Europe, we relied on a combination of spatial and temporal analyses. In the former, five of the most important western European rice growing regions in Spain, Italy and France were compared in terms of habitat composition over the 2002-2012 period. The relative importance of natural wetlands and ricefields (either dry or flooded) in determining the abundance of wintering ducks was then established. In the second approach, the trends in duck numbers before and after implementation of winter-flooding Agri-Environment Schemes (AES) were compared in two of the study regions. Both approaches highlighted the role of winter ricefield flooding in explaining wintering duck numbers and complementing the natural wetlands; flooding harvested ricefields improves habitat attractiveness by enhancing food resource accessibility. In Europe, the proportion of ricefields flooded during winter varies considerably between countries (0.17-62\%), owing to differences in policy initiatives such as Agri-Environment Schemes. Promoting such schemes more widely across the European rice production area could make a big difference in terms of waterfowl habitat quality at the scale of their wintering range.},

  abstract = {Rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivation is an important part of global food security, yet it is also responsible for a significant portion of agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly methane (CH4). Midseason drainage of flooded rice fields can decrease CH4 emissions, but the magnitude of CH4 reduction and its effect on grain yield are variable due to variation in the timing and soil-drying severity of drainage across studies. Therefore, in this two-year study, we aimed to quantify the effect of timing and severity of a single midseason drainage event on seasonal GHG emissions and grain yields, compared to a continuously flooded (CF) control. Treatments varied in terms of soil-drying severity (low, medium, and high, corresponding to approximately 5, 8, and 12 days of drying, respectively) and the timing of when drainage events occurred (between 34--49 and 45--59 days after seeding, or roughly between tillering and panicle initiation). Soil moisture parameters (perched water table, volumetric water content, gravimetric water content (GWC), and soil water potential), soil mineral nitrogen, CH4 and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, grain yield, and yield components were all quantified. Midseason drainage reduced seasonal CH4 emissions by 38--66\%, compared to the CF control. Seasonal CH4 emissions decreased with increasing drain severity, and for every 1\% reduction in soil GWC during the drainage period, seasonal CH4 emissions were reduced by 2.5\%. The timing of drainage had no significant impact on CH4 emissions. Emissions of N2O were low (average = 0.035 kg N2O-N ha 1) and accounted for only 0.5\% of the seasonal global warming potential (GWP) across all drainage treatments. Within each year, drainage did not significantly affect grain yield compared to the CF control. Additionally, midseason drainage reduced both GWP and yield-scaled GWP by approximately the same amount as seasonal CH4 emissions, as N2O emissions were minimal and yields were similar across treatments. These results indicate that midseason drainage may be a viable GHG mitigation practice in flooded rice systems with limited risk for yield reduction, however, this practice should also be further tested under a broad range of soil types and different environments to determine its widespread adoptability.},

  abstract = {Context or Problem: Flooded rice systems produce an important staple crop but are a source of methane (CH4) and arsenic (As) exposure. Introducing non-continuous flooding events can decrease seasonal CH4 emissions and grain As concentration. A single mid-season drain (MD: a 7-to 10-day soil drying period during the mid-season) is easier for farmers to manage than multiple drain events (e.g. alternate wetting and drying). Previous research has shown that a MD can accomplish these goals without yield reduction. However, depending on soils and precipitation, the soil drying severity during a MD can vary substantially. Objective or Research Question: The objectives of this study were to compare a MD to the farmer practice under on-farm conditions with respect to yields, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and As and cadmium (Cd -- which can increase with non-continuous flooding). Second, to quantify the relationship between soil drying severity during the MD and the reduction in CH4 emissions and grain As. Methods: A three-year study with seven on-farm trials was implemented. Each trial had two treatments: a MD and the farmer practice. Grain yields, GHG emissions, and grain As and Cd concentrations were quantified for each treatment. Results: Grain yields were similar between treatments. The MD decreased seasonal CH4 emissions by 20--77\% (average of 52\%), with the magnitude of reduction being related to soil-drying severity during the MD. Combining previous on-station data with this on-farm data, indicates that for every 1\% reduction in soil gravimetric water content (GWC), seasonal CH4 emissions were reduced by 2.5\% (r2 = 0.47). With MD, N2O emissions increased (average = 0.25 kg N2O-N ha-1), but accounted for only 3\% of the global warming potential. The MD decreased grain As concentration (by 20\% on average, but not related to soil drying severity), and there was no effect on grain Cd concentrations. Conclusions: Given these results, an MD has similar GHG mitigation potential to other non-continuous flooding practices that require more drain periods and may be more difficult to implement. These results indicate that a MD is a viable on-farm management practice for GHG mitigation and reducing grain As concentration with limited risk of yield reduction. Implications or Significance: This is the first research that has documented the relationship between soil drying severity and reduction in CH4 emissions across soils. This relationship is a potentially useful tool for on-farm monitoring, but will need to be developed further across more locations.},

This system is based on visual, geometric and tactile features of the wood in the field; however, a detailed chemical characterization is often missing. Furthermore, the driving mechanisms (particularly substrate quality vs. environmental conditions) of deadwood decay are controversially discussed. Consequently, we investigated how typical major and minor chemical parameters of wood were correlated with the decay stage. The decomposition patterns of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst) and European larch (Larix deciduas Mill.) CWD of an Alpine setting were analyzed, and how the chemical and physical parameters were affected by the substrate and environmental conditions was checked. Two altitudinal sequences, having a different exposure (northvs. south-facing sites), were sampled. We measured main biochemical compounds (lignin and cellulose), physical properties (density and water content), element concentrations (C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn), and the carbon isotopic signature ({$\delta$}13C) of living trees and CWD at five decomposition stages (decay classes). Most investigated wood physico-chemical parameters such as wood density, water content, lignin and cellulose and even minor constituents (N, Ca, Mg, P, Fe, Mn) correlated well to the five decay-class system. Some important components, such as the carbon concentration and {$\delta$}13C, did not vary with increasing decomposition. Our hypothesis that the different substrate should be traceable during CWD decay had to be rejected, although some statistically significant chemical differences between larch and spruce were measured in the living trees. The chosen tree species were probably not different enough to be chemically traceable in the CWD. Already in decay class 1, these differences were zeroed. The site conditions (expressed by the different altitudes and exposure) influenced only some of the investigated parameters, namely lignin, the {$\delta$}13C isotopic ratio and nutrients such as P, Ca and K.},

Marked differences in C/N/P stoichiometry were observed between deadwood in an advanced decomposition stage and the soil immediately under the log. The average C/ N/P ratio of soil under the influence of deadwood was narrower compared to the C/N/P ratio of deadwood. The C/N/P ratio of studied soils was similar to the expected C/N/P ratio of organic soils or humus. The results indicate that stage of decomposition and tree species have an impact on the elemental stoichiometry of the soil.

A two-year on-farm experiment was conducted from 2010-2012 to test the hypothesis that optimal N rates result in maximum agronomic productivity and minimal yield-scaled GWP in water-seeded rice systems experiencing continuously flooded conditions during the growing season and fallow period. Five fertilizer N rates (0, 80, 140, 200 and 260kgNha-1yr-1) were applied as aqua ammonia and annual N2O and CH4 emissions were quantified using the vented, closed chamber method. Results indicate that low N2O emissions occurred regardless of N rate when a permanent flood was maintained, but that large N2O fluxes occurred during discrete field drainage periods prior to harvest, particularly at high N rates. Hence, cumulative N2O emissions increased with N rate in a nonlinear manner during the growing season. Over the entire cropping cycle, the highest CH4 fluxes occurred during the middle of the growing season and following field drainage periods prior to harvest and at the conclusion of the fallow period. Mean seasonal and annual CH4 emissions tended to increase with N addition compared to the control, but significant differences were not observed between N rates. While CH4 and N2O emissions were generally not affected by N rate during the fallow period, the fallow period contributed significantly to annual emissions (e.g. 56\% of annual N2O emissions across N rates). Across years, CH4represented 94\% of total GWP and as a result, mean annual GWP increased with N rate up to 140kgNha-1. Maximum yields occurred between 140 and 200kgNha-1, thus by employing the yield-scaled metric to begin to integrate climate change and global food demand concerns, mean annual yield-scaled GWP significantly decreased by 49\% at these N rates. These findings suggest that optimal yields can be achieved with simultaneous reductions in yield-scaled GWP through efficient fertilizer N management in water-seeded rice systems experiencing continuously flooded conditions during the growing season and fallow period. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Rice (Oryza sativa L.) establishment systems based on resource-conserving production practices are gaining popularity globally. To investigate the potential for improved N management and mitigation of methane (CH4) emissions, field experiments were conducted in California on three crop establishment systems: water-seeded (WS) conventional, WS stale seedbed, and drill-seeded (DS) stale seedbed. Fertilizer nitrogen recovery efficiency (NRE) and rice yield as affected by N rate, source, and application timing were evaluated for 2 yr in each system. Methane emissions were monitored over a full annual rice production cycle (growing season plus fallow period). Results indicated that neither split N applications nor ammonium sulfate increased yields or NRE compared with a single application of urea, regardless of system. However, the economic optimum N rate increased by approximately 30 kg N ha-1 in WS stale seedbed compared with the conventional system. Since NRE generally remained similar across N treatments that maximized yields, applying the appropriate N rate as a single dose before the permanent flood would satisfy both agronomic and environmental goals of N management within each system. Both WS systems resulted in similar growing season CH4 emissions. However, the DS system reduced CH4 emissions by 47\% compared with the conventional WS system, possibly due to a decreased period of anaerobic soil conditions. this study highlights the importance of assessing benefits as well as tradeoffs when evaluating opportunities for increasing the sustainability of direct-seeded establishment systems with respect to N management and CH4 emissions. {\copyright} 2014 by the American Society of Agronomy, 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711.

They are, however, subject to rapid and fundamental transformations across Europe, mainly as a result of intensification or abandonment of land uses. Our objective is to assess the possible future drivers of cultural landscape changes and their likely impacts on ecosystem services provision as perceived by local actors. We present stakeholder-based scenarios for the Swabian Alb, a biosphere reserve in southern Germany, projected to the yr 2040. On their basis, we explore the possibilities and limitations of local civil engagement for landscape conservation and development in the face of increasing global influences. The steps of the process are (a) identifying the key driving forces of landscape change, (b) developing contrasting narratives about alternative landscape futures, (c) refining the narratives, (d) discussing scenario impacts, and (e) exploring local management strategies. Four contrasting scenarios created by the stakeholders are presented. Global-level drivers are state support/regulations vs. freemarket economy, and energy-intensive lifestyles vs. low-energy economy. Local-level forces are high vs. low consumer demand for localized food, and high vs. low appreciation of local cultural landscapes. Outcomes show that cultural landscape development may come to a crossroads over the next 30 yrs, with either combined land abandonment and landscape industrialization scenarios or multifunctional, locally distinct landscape futures being possible. The scenario narratives envision that the most powerful way to develop and protect distinct landscapes is to foster local people's links to cultural landscapes, to build social capital around them, and to direct consumption patterns toward localized food production. We find that participatory scenario processes have strengths in terms of the credibility, transferability, and confirmability of the insights gained, but are often weak in ensuring dependability.},

The ability to scale up is made possible by the reduced hands-on time and cost per sample provided by the newest kits, platforms and software tools. Results gleaned from broad-scale monitoring will provide opportunities to address key scientific questions linked to biodiversity and its dynamics across time and space as well as being more relevant for policymakers, enabling science-based decision-making, and provide a greater socio-economic impact.

  abstract = {A temperature increase higher than the global mean is likely for Central Europe until the end of the century. Historic climate records reveal that the temperature in eastern Austria has already increased by about 2 {$^\circ$}C over the last 50 years. We investigated the responses of ecophysiological and productivity indicators to climate change of the Vienna Woods, the neighbouring forests of the Austrian capital, to assess potential impacts on forest functioning. In this impact analysis, we used the biogeochemical mechanistic model Biome-BGC and ran it with 50 years of historic climate data and regional climate change projections based on IPCC emission scenarios A1B and B1 until 2100. We projected sustained productivity until the end of the twenty-first century. Lowered soil water potentials, however, seem to limit a productivity increase, especially in the low elevation areas, while the canopy leaf area, annual soil water outflow and annual mean water use efficiency are projected to remain constant or increase. We conclude that the forests in the greenbelt of Vienna are not severely prone to negative functional climate change effects, and therefore, key forest functions concerning welfare and recreation can be maintained in the Vienna Woods.},

Unquestionably a dominant feature of most ecosystems, invertebrates affect many ecosystem services and are also highly responsive to climate change. However, there is still a basic lack of understanding of the direct and indirect paths by which invertebrates influence ecosystem services, as well as how climate change will affect those ecosystem services by altering invertebrate populations. This indicates a lack of communication and collaboration among scientists researching ecosystem services and climate change effects on invertebrates, and land managers and researchers from other disciplines, which becomes obvious when systematically reviewing the literature relevant to invertebrates, ecosystem services, and climate change. To address this issue, we review how invertebrates respond to climate change. We then review how invertebrates both positively and negatively influence ecosystem services. Lastly, we provide some critical future directions for research needs, and suggest ways in which managers, scientists and other researchers may collaborate to tackle the complex issue of sustaining invertebrate-mediated services under a changing climate.},

  abstract = {Deadwood is a resource of water, nutrients, and carbon, as well as an important driving factor of spatial pedocomplexity and hillslope processes in forested landscapes. The applicability of existing relevant studies in mountain forests in Central Europe is limited by the low number of data, absence of precise dating, and short time periods studied. Here, we aimed to assess the decomposition pathway in terms of changes and variability in the physical characteristics of deadwood (wood density, biomass, and moisture) during the decomposition process, and to describe differences in decomposition rate. The research was carried out in the {\v Z}of{\'i}nsk{\'y} Primeval Forest, one of the oldest forest reserves in Europe. Samples were taken from sapwood of downed logs of the three main tree species: Fagus sylvatica L., Abies alba Mill., and Picea abies (L.) Karst. The time since the death of each downed log was obtained using tree censuses repeated since 1975 and dendrochronology. The maximal time since the death of a log was species-specific, and ranged from 61--76 years. The rate of change (slope) of moisture content along the time since death in a linear regression model was the highest for F. sylvatica (b = 3.94) compared to A. alba (b = 2.21) and P. abies (b = 1.93). An exponential model showing the dependence of biomass loss on time since death revealed that F. sylvatica stems with a diameter of 50--90 cm had the shortest decomposition rate---51 years---followed by P. abies (71 years) and A. alba (72 years). Our findings can be used in geochemical models of element cycles in temperate old-growth forests, the prediction of deadwood dynamics and changes in related biodiversity, and in refining management recommendations.},

Increasing landscape heterogeneity has been suggested to increase biodiversity across habitats, while increasing crop heterogeneity may support biodiversity within agroecosystems. These spatial heterogeneity effects can be partitioned into compositional (land-cover type diversity) and configurational heterogeneity (land-cover type arrangement), measured either for the crop mosaic or across the landscape for both crops and semi-natural habitats. However, studies have reported mixed responses of biodiversity to increases in these heterogeneity components across taxa and contexts. Our meta-analysis covering 6397 fields across 122 studies conducted in Asia, Europe, North and South America reveals consistently positive effects of crop and landscape heterogeneity, as well as compositional and configurational heterogeneity for plant, invertebrate, vertebrate, pollinator and predator biodiversity. Vertebrates and plants benefit more from landscape heterogeneity, while invertebrates derive similar benefits from both crop and landscape heterogeneity. Pollinators benefit more from configurational heterogeneity, but predators favour compositional heterogeneity. These positive effects are consistent for invertebrates and vertebrates in both tropical/subtropical and temperate agroecosystems, and in annual and perennial cropping systems, and at small to large spatial scales. Our results suggest that promoting increased landscape heterogeneity by diversifying crops and semi-natural habitats, as suggested in the current UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, is key for restoring biodiversity in agricultural landscapes.},

This is due to limitations regarding the resolution of classical methods used for characterizing WIF communities and to a lack of wellreplicated long-term experiments with sufficient numbers of tree species. Here, we used a large scale experiment with logs of 11 tree species at an early stage of decomposition, distributed across three regions of Germany, to identify the factors shaping WIF community composition and Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) richness using next generation sequencing. We found that tree species identity was the most significant factor, corresponding to (P {$<$} 0.001) and explaining 10\% (representing 48\% of the explainable variance) of the overall WIF community composition. The next important group of variables were wood-physicochemical properties, of which wood pH was the only factor that consistently corresponded to WIF community composition. For overall WIF richness patterns, we found that approximately 20\% of the total variance was explained by wood N content, location, tree species identity and wood density. It is noteworthy that the importance of determinants of WIF community composition and richness appeared to depend greatly on tree species group (broadleaved vs. coniferous) and it differed between the fungal phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota.},

In this Review, we outline the characteristics of GHG emissions (CH4 and N2O) from paddy soils, focusing on climate change effects and mitigation strategies. Global mean annual area-scaled and yield-scaled GHG emissions are {$\sim$}7,870 kg CO2e ha-1 and 0.9 kg CO2e kg-1, respectively, with 94\% from CH4. However, emissions vary markedly, primarily reflecting the impact of management practices. In particular, organic matter additions and continuous flooding of paddies both stimulate CH4 emissions, whereas fertilizer N application rate is the most important driver of N2O emissions. Although contemporary changes in emissions are uncertain, future elevated [CO2] and warming are projected to increase CH4 emissions by 4--40\% and 15--23\%, respectively. Yet, integrated agronomic management strategies --- including cultivar, organic matter, water, tillage and nitrogen management --- offer GHG mitigation potential. In particular, new rice variety selection, non-continuous flooding and straw removal strategies reduce GHG emissions by 24\%, 44\% and 46\% on average, respectively. However, approaches need to be optimized on the basis of seasonal CH4 emission patterns, necessitating improved quantification and reduced uncertainty in regional and global GHG estimates, especially in low latitudes.},

To test whether co-occurrence patterns of native versus alien species are structured by environmental filtering or biotic associations. Location: Mediterranean, Iberian Peninsula, Ebro River catchment. Methods: We modelled freshwater fish distributions and their association with environmental conditions using a hurdle model-like approach involving boosted regression trees. Additionally, we applied a joint species distribution model to quantify the co-occurrence of native versus alien fish species that can be attributed to shared environmental responses or potentially to biotic interactions. Results: Our results point to environmental factors, rather than biotic associations, as major correlates of the increase of alien and the decline of native fishes in the Ebro River. We observed contrasting patterns of native versus alien species along the upstream-downstream gradient. Alien species dominated in the lower reaches associated with warmer temperatures, higher shares of intensive land use and appeared facilitated by dams and river regulation. Native species richness was highest in the larger tributaries followed by a strong decline in the main stem which was related to the river network position and land use type. Fragmentation played a subordinate role in explaining fish richness and abundance patterns. Main conclusions: Given the strong association with temperature, a further range expansion of alien fishes in the Ebro with future climate change may be expected. More local-scale factors related to habitat degradation and hydrologic alteration will further exacerbate the invasion success of many alien fishes. Further multiple, independent species introductions might mask isolation and fragmentation effects of dams on the future spread and distribution of alien fish.},

  abstract = {Emission rates of CH4 were measured in microcosms of submerged soil which were planted with rice. Drainage of the rice microcosms for 48 h resulted in drastically decreased CH4 emission rates which only slowly recovered to the rates of the undrained controls. Drainage also resulted in drastically increased sulphate concentrations which only slowly decreased to nearly zero background values after the microcosms were submerged again. The mechanisms responsible for the decrease of CH4 production by aeration were investigated in slurries of a loamy and a sandy Italian rice soil. Incubation of the soil slurries under anoxic conditions resulted first in the reduction of nitrate, sulphate and ferric iron before CH4 production started. Incubation of the soil slurries for 48 h under air resulted in immediate and complete inhibition of CH4 production. Although the soil slurries were then again incubated under anoxic conditions (N2 atmosphere), the inhibition of CH4 production persisted for more than 30 days. The redox potential of the soil increased after the aeration but returned within 15 days to the low values typical for CH4 production. However, the concentrations of sulphate and of ferric iron increased dramatically after the aeration and stayed at elevated levels for the period during which CH4 production was inhibited. These observations show that even brief exposure of the soil to O2 allowed the production of sulphate and ferric iron from their reduced precursors. Elevated sulphate and ferric iron concentrations allowed sulphate-reducing and ferric iron-reducing bacteria to outcompete methanogenic bacteria on H2 as common substrate. Indeed, concentrations of H2 were decreased as long as sulphate and ferric iron were high so that the Gibbs free energy of CH4 production from H2/CO2 was also increased (less exergonic). On the other hand, concentrations of acetate, the more important precursor for CH4, were not much affected by the short aeration of the soil slurries, and the Gibbs free energy of CH4 production from acetate was highly exergonic suggesting that acetotrophic methanogens were not outcompeted but were otherwise inhibited. Aeration also resulted in increased rates of CO2 production and in a short-term increase of N2O production. However, these increases were {\textbackslash}textless 10\% of the decreased production of CH4 and did not represent a trade-off in terms of CO2 equivalents. Hence, short-term drainage and aeration of submerged paddy fields may be a useful mitigation option for decreasing the emission of greenhouse gases.},

Enhancing important provisioning ecosystem services, such as food and timber, often leads to tradeoffs between regulating and cultural ecosystem services, such as nutrient cycling, flood protection, and tourism. We developed a framework for analyzing the provision of multiple ecosystem services across landscapes and present an empirical demonstration of ecosystem service bundles, sets of services that appear together repeatedly. Ecosystem service bundles were identified by analyzing the spatial patterns of 12 ecosystem services in a mixed-use landscape consisting of 137 municipalities in Quebec, Canada. We identified six types of ecosystem service bundles and were able to link these bundles to areas on the landscape characterized by distinct social--ecological dynamics. Our results show landscape-scale tradeoffs between provisioning and almost all regulating and cultural ecosystem services, and they show that a greater diversity of ecosystem services is positively correlated with the provision of regulating ecosystem services. Ecosystem service-bundle analysis can identify areas on a landscape where ecosystem management has produced exceptionally desirable or undesirable sets of ecosystem services.},

  abstract = {Flooding rice fields in the US mid-south during the fallow season (November--March) for migratory waterfowl habitats provides revenue from hunting-related activities and helps with soil retention and water quality. However, flooding has the potential to increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Research on GHG emissions in US mid-south during the fallow season has been limited. Eddy covariance (EC) systems measuring CO2 and CH4 fluxes were installed during the 2015--2016, 2016--2017, and 2017--2018 fallow seasons at paired production-sized fields in NE Arkansas. Rice residue was burned after harvest at both field locations. The paired fields were separated by an access road and consisted of one field flooded (F) with precipitation by installing barriers to prevent drainage and the other field allowed to drain or non-flooded field (NF). Flooding did not influence CO2 emissions during the fallow season significantly. However, F fields emitted 45 {\textpm} 2\% more CH4 than NF fields. The three-year fallow season average was 1408 {\textpm} 185 kg CO2-C ha-1 season-1 and 12.5 {\textpm} 2.0 kg CH4-C ha-1 season-1 in F fields and 1355 {\textpm} 132 kg CO2-C ha-1 season-1 and 8.6 {\textpm} 1.4 kg CH4-C ha-1 season-1 in NF fields. Methane contributed 5 to 10\% global warming potential (GWP), reported as CO2 equivalents from CO2 and CH4 measurements. The three-year fallow season average GWP was not different by treatment. Increases in fallow season GWP were noted to increase after rice cultivation. These findings will improve our overall understanding and modeling of GHG emissions from agricultural fields during an understudied but important period of the year.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the vertical dependence of the basic density of Scots pine, Norway spruce, and birch stems, and how such dependence could be applied for determining the average stem wood density. The study material consisted of 38 Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), 39 Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) and 15 birch (Betula pendula and Betula pubescens) stands located on mineral soil sites in southern Finland. The stem material mainly represented thinning removal from stands at different stages of development. The linear mixed model technique, with both fixed and random effects, was used to estimate the model. According to the fixed part of the model, wood density was dependent on the vertical location along the stem in all three tree species. Wood density in pine decreased from the butt to the top, and the gradient in wood density was steep at the butt but decreased in the upper part of the stem. The vertical dependence was similar in birch, but the density gradient was much smaller. For spruce the vertical dependence of the basic density was moderate. The model can be calibrated for a tree stem when one or more sample disks are measured at freely selected heights. Using treewise calibrated predictions of the vertical density dependence and measured stem diameters, almost unbiased estimates, and lower prediction errors than with traditional methods, were obtained for the average stem wood density. The advantages of the method were greater for pine with a strong vertical dependence in basic density, than for spruce and birch.},

  abstract = {We present the results of a systematic, unbiased national survey of deadwood volume and biomass in New Zealand's remaining indigenous forests based on an 8-km grid of 894 permanent plots. New Zealand's old growth evergreen temperate forests are largely comprised of long-lived, slow-growing tree species typically growing in cool, humid conditions; collectively these conditions are thought to promote accumulation of high deadwood stocks. We estimated deadwood biomass and volume in New Zealand's forests and compared these stocks with published values from other broadleaved evergreen temperate forests. Mean deadwood biomass in New Zealand was 54 Mg ha 1 but ranged across plots from 0 to 550 Mg ha 1. Mean deadwood volume was 158 m3 ha 1 and ranged across plots from 0 to 1890 m3 ha 1. Fallen logs accounted for 63\% of total deadwood volume and 65\% of total deadwood biomass, with standing dead trees being the remainder. Each piece of deadwood was classified into one of three broad decay classes and {$>$}40\% of deadwood was fallen logs of the intermediate decay class. Deadwood biomass and volume varied 1.8- and 1.9-fold, respectively, among forest types and was greatest in broadleaved forests, dominated by Weinmannia racemosa (Cunoniaceae), Metrosideros umbellata (Myrtaceae) and Metrosideros robusta, and broadleaf-Nothofagus (Nothofagaceae) forests supporting the large tree species Nothofagus fusca. Deadwood biomass and volume were least in broadleaf-conifer admixtures. We used structural equation models to determine whether deadwood biomass could be predicted from climate and environment (vapor pressure deficit, elevation and slope), live tree biomass, forest composition (captured by two ordination axes), wood density of live trees, and tree size (a proxy for stand age). The model that best fit the data retained only vapor pressure deficit, live tree biomass and the first ordination axis as predictors of deadwood biomass. However, this model predicted just 2.4\% of the variation in deadwood biomass, suggesting that additional factors not captured by this dataset, such as disturbance dynamics, may control deadwood abundance. Comparisons with other temperate and tropical forests did not support the hypothesis that New Zealand's cool temperate rainforests support higher than expected biomass or volume of deadwood.},

  abstract = {This report examines the costs and benefits of alternate wetting and drying (AWD) in paddy rice production in Bangladesh and Vietnam as a technology that can lead to reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. AWD is a systematic management practice that involves periodic drying and reflooding of rice fields. Similar water management practices in rice growing have been used in Asian countries for decades, although not optimized for GHG reduction (Richards and Sander 2014). This report reviews the literature and examines the potential costs and benefits of implementing AWD at national scales in Bangladesh and Vietnam, two countries with current interest in promoting large-scale adoption of AWD. The report summarizes the wealth of information on the agronomic benefits of AWD, yet finds very little evidence of AWD's economic impacts, especially in conjunction with impacts on GHG emissions. The analysis provides a synthesis of the costs and benefits of AWD (e.g., production costs, revenues, yields, other benefits) on a per-hectare basis and a preliminary estimate of the technology's national-level impacts and implementation costs. It must be noted that only one study could be found on the production costs of AWD in Vietnam; thus more representative cost data would be required. Program implementation costs were estimated based on information found in the budgets from a relevant Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action program in the Philippines and other agriculture sector technical assistance projects Existing evidence and expert opinion indicate that AWD is very promising in terms of its potential to increase farmers' yields and profits and GHG reduction potential in Bangladesh and Vietnam. Adoption of AWD may allow for additional profit for farmers of between \vphantom\{\}100 and \vphantom\{\}400/ha as well as a reduction of 0.8 to 4 tCO2e/ha. The increased profit is due to decreased irrigation costs and increased yields from the use of AWD.},

  abstract = {Coastal wetlands are dynamic ecosystems that exist at the interface between land and sea. They represent environments with a great diversity of habitats and communities, high carbon sequestration capacity and a wide range of ecosystem services. In the Mediterranean, the largest coastal wetlands are found in deltaic areas like that of the Ebro River (Spain), which has a coastline length of approximately 50 km, occupying a total area of 325 km2. The Ebro Delta is included in different national and international frameworks for environmental conservation, despite which there are several risks that threaten it. The lack of sedimentary contributions due to the regulation of the Ebro riverbed (irrigation, reservoirs, and hydroelectric power generation) has caused erosion and the retreat of certain sections of its coastline. To this situation of sediment deficit must be added the threat posed by the effects of global change, such as the rise in sea level, the increase in temperature and in the frequency and intensity of storms. This study analyses the particularities of the coastal wetland of the Ebro Delta, identifying the main threats it faces, as well as possible adaptation and mitigation strategies to these changes.},

Using a transformative governance lens, we use the case of the Norwegian "Climate Cure 2030" for the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector to, first, illustrate the mechanisms that have led to the choice of climate mitigation measures; second, to analyze the potential consequences of these measures on biodiversity and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; and, third, to evaluate alternative measures with potential positive outcomes for biodiversity and GHG emissions/removals.

  abstract = {Forest ecosystems play a critical role in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. Forest carbon (C) is stored through photosynthesis and released via decomposition and combustion. Relative to C fixation in biomass, much less is known about C depletion through decomposition of woody debris, particularly under a changing climate. It is assumed that the increased temperatures and longer growing seasons associated with projected climate change will increase the decomposition rates (i.e., more rapid C cycling) of downed woody debris (DWD); however, the magnitude of this increase has not been previously addressed. Using DWD measurements collected from a national forest inventory of the eastern United States, we show that the residence time of DWD may decrease (i.e., more rapid decomposition) by as much as 13 \% over the next 200 years, depending on various future climate change scenarios and forest types. Although existing dynamic global vegetation models account for the decomposition process, they typically do not include the effect of a changing climate on DWD decomposition rates. We expect that an increased understanding of decomposition rates, as presented in this current work, will be needed to adequately quantify the fate of woody detritus in future forests. Furthermore, we hope these results will lead to improved models that incorporate climate change scenarios for depicting future dead wood dynamics in addition to a traditional emphasis on live-tree demographics.},

  abstract = {This chapter provides a state-of-the art of the who is who in the biological communities of the Ebro river, as well as considerations about the threats imposed by habitat deterioration, eutrophication, pollution and species invasions, as well as the current knowledge gaps that still exist. The chapter is structured in three main sections describing the structure and composition of aquatic biological communities (phytoplankton, macroinvertebrates and fish communities), the problematic of invasive species and other hazards, and the management and conservation actions related to ecosystem health. The longitudinal patterns of planktonic chlorophyll concentration did not follow a regular pattern of increase in the Ebro River. Planktonic chlorophyll sharply decreased after the large reservoir system located in the lower reaches. Those changes were not solely explained by nutrient availability, but by alterations in the hydrological regime due to flow regulation. The lower water residence time in this section favors the growth of submerged macrophytes. Zebra mussels (Dreissenia polymorpha) invasion shows a massive proliferation in the lower part of the river. Biodiversity and density of macroinvertebrates decrease in the regulated areas of the river. Macroinvertebrate communities in the lower part of the river are mostly filter feeders (e.g., Hydropsyche spp., Ephoron virgo). Nevertheless, the biological quality based on macroinvertebrates has improved during the last decade in the mid and low reaches of the tributaries. Stable populations of the critically endangered giant European freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera auricularia) occur in the middle Ebro section. Fish populations have been deeply altered, allochthonous fish species accounting for the 42\% of the total fish species in the Ebro. Most native fish species are considered as vulnerable or threatened. Although a recent bioassessment indicates ``good'' and ``very good'' status in the 70--77\% of the Ebro tributaries, caution must be taken on the potential hazards (e.g., global change, climate change) affecting the Ebro system, especially in the prospect of global change. Lower precipitation regime and higher water abstraction in rivers of the Mediterranean region such as the Ebro could contribute to the complexity loss of habitats, loss of biodiversity, and loss of ecosystem functions (e.g., nutrient recycling). The combined higher residence flow and increased nutrient concentrations in these scenarios could further enhance phytoplankton growth.},

  abstract = {Based on the results of continuous flux measurements at the Mase paddy flux site in central Japan, carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange between a customarily cultivated single rice-cropping paddy field and the atmosphere during the 2002 growing season was analyzed. The daily Net Ecosystem CO 2 Exchange (NEE) showed a seasonal variation with a maximum uptake rate of 39 g CO2 m-2 day-1 in late July when the leaf area index of the rice reached its peak. Daily NEE turned positive, indicating emission from the paddy, about 2 weeks before harvest, because of the declining photosynthesis rate of rice in its mature stage and enhanced ecosystem respiration from the drained paddy. Quantum yield of the primary crop showed a declining seasonal trend from 0.11 mol CO2 (mol quantum)-1 in the early growth stage to below 0.05 mol CO2 (mol quantum)-1 after heading. The ratoon crop had little effect on the seasonal CO2 budget of 2002, because its growing period was restricted to 1 month. The paddy field acted as a CO2 sink for about 100 days from late May until the end of August, indicating that the paddy field functioned as a source of CO2 for more than 70\% of the year. The ratio of gross primary production (GPP) to ecosystem respiration (Re) was 1.53 for the primary crop period and 0.43 for the ratoon crop period. Drained days accounted for as many as a half of the primary crop period days and the ratoon crop period was restricted in length, thus we obtained small ratios of GPP to Re in the two periods. During the post-heading period, the half-hourly CO2 storage below the flux measurement height was occasionally comparable in magnitude to the eddy CO2 flux over the canopy. When the friction velocity was less than 0.1 m s-1, the storage term accounted for 6\% of NEE on average even after influence of temperature on nighttime NEE was removed. Estimating the storage term from a single height measurement underestimated it by 22\%. {\copyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

To do so requires estimated values of wood density and C and N concentrations. Additionally, parameters that show variation should be examined. In this study, we clarified the estimated values and the variation in three parameters in each decay class of each of two tree species and examined whether dead log diameter and region contribute to variation in the parameters. Data were collected from 73 Chamaecyparis obtusa (Sieb. et Zucc.) Endl. plantations and 66 Cryptomeria japonica D. Don plantations throughout Japan. Wood densities decreased from 386 to 188 kg m 3 for C. obtusa and from 334 to 188 kg m 3 for C. japonica in decay classes 1---4. The variation in wood density increased with decay class, and the coefficient of variance increased from 13.9\% to 46.4\% for C. obtusa and from 15.2\% to 48.1\% for C. japonica. The N concentrations increased from 1.04 to 4.40 g kg 1 for C. obtusa and from 1.11 to 2.97 g kg 1 for C. japonica in decay classes 1---4. The variation in N concentration increased with decay class, and the coefficient of variance increased from 51.9\% to 76.7\% for C. obtusa and from 50.3\% to 70.4\% for C. japonica. Log diameter and region contributed to variations in wood density and N concentration in decay classes 1 and 2 for C. obtusa and C. japonica. However, no relationship was observed between regional climates and the two parameters. In contrast, C concentrations ranged from 507 to 535 g kg 1 and were stable with much lower coefficients of variance throughout the decay classes for both tree species. Thus, we recommend that the same C concentration can be adapted for all decay classes of both tree species.},

However, its adoption rate has been low despite the decade of dissemination in Asia, especially in the Philippines. Using cross-sectional farm-level survey data, this study empirically explored factors shaping AWD adoption in a gravity surface irrigation system. We used regression-based approaches to examine the factors influencing farmers' adoption of AWD and its impact on yield. Results showed that the majority of the AWD adopters were farmers who practiced enforced rotational irrigation (RI) scheduling within their irrigators' association (IA). With the current irrigation management system, the probability of AWD implementation increases when farmers do not interfere with the irrigation schedule (otherwise they opt to go with flooding). Interestingly, the awareness factor did not play a significant role in the farmers' adoption due to the RI setup. However, the perception of water management as an effective weed control method was positively significant, suggesting that farmers are likely to adopt AWD if weeds are not a major issue in their field. Furthermore, the impact on grain yields did not differ with AWD. Thus, given the RI scheduling already in place within the IA, we recommend fine-tuning this setup following the recommended safe AWD at the IA scale.},

  abstract = {The implementation of alley cropping in orchards has been suggested as a sustainable strategy to increase farmer revenues by crop diversification, enhance soil organic matter (SOM) and fertility, water retention, overall biodiversity, and contribute to climate change mitigation. Thus, the objective of this study was to assess if alley cropping with annual crops can contribute to i) mitigate soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, ii) enhance C sequestration in a semiarid Mediterranean irrigated citrus orchard, and iii) increase land productivity. For this, two different treatments were established: i) conventional mandarin monoculture (MC) with no alley cropping; and ii) mandarin diversified with alley cropping of barley/vetch and fava bean (DIV). Measurements of soil CO2 and N2O emissions were periodically performed (every 7--20 days) during two years. Soil CO2 emission rates followed the soil moisture trend, and showed no significant differences between treatments. As an average, soil CO2 emission rates were 147 mg m-2 h-1 in MC and 196 mg m-2 h-1 in DIV. Soil N2O emission rates were not correlated to soil moisture nor temperature, and showed average values of 0.026 mg m-2 h-1 in MC and - 0.002 mg m-2 h-1 in DIV. Alley cropping did not contribute to significantly increase soil organic C and total nitrogen in two years' time. With regard to production, mandarin yield showed no significant differences between treatments, but alley crops contributed to complementary commodities to the main cash crop, increasing overall land productivity. Thus, alley cropping in irrigated Mediterranean orchards has no significant effect on soil C sequestration and GHG emissions at short-term, with increased land productivity owing to new commodities grown in the alleys. These results confirm that under semiarid Mediterranean climate, long periods are needed to efficiently assess soil C sequestration potential of sustainable practices in orchards.},

  abstract = {Rice fields contribute substantially to global warming of the atmosphere through emission of methane (CH4). This article reviews the state of the art of factors affecting CH4 emissions in rice fields, focusing on soil organic matter content and water management practices. A quantitative relationship between these factors was established through a meta-analysis based on a literature survey. This relationship can be useful to update emission factors used to estimate CH4 in the National Emission Inventories. Methane emissions in rice fields can be as much as 90\% higher in continuously flooded rice fields compared with other water management practices, independent from straw addition. Water management systems that involve absence of flooding in total or for part of the growing period such as midseason drainages, intermittent flooding, and percolation control, can reduce CH4 emissions substantially. Moreover, CH4 emissions increase with the amount of straw added up to 7.7 t/ha for continuously flooded soils and up to 5.1 t/ha for other water regimes. Above these levels, no further increase is produced with further addition of straw. With regard to rice straw management mitigation strategies, recommended practices are composting rice straw, straw burning under controlled conditions, recollecting rice straw for biochar production, generation of energy, to be used as a substrate, or to obtain other byproducts with added value. This review improves the understanding of the relationship between straw application rate, water regimes, and CH4 emissions from rice fields to date. This relationship can help to select the most appropriate management practices to improve current mitigation strategies to reduce atmospheric CH4. {\copyright} 2012 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

  abstract = {Irrigated rice cultivation is a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture. Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are emitted not only throughout the growing season but also in the fallow period between crops. A study was conducted for two transition periods between rice crops (dry to wet season transition and wet to dry season transition) in the Philippines to investigate the effect of water and tillage management on CH4 and N2O emissions as well as on soil nitrate and ammonium. Management treatments between rice crops included (1) continuous flooding (F), (2) soil drying (D), (3) soil drying with aerobic tillage (D + T), and (4) soil drying and wetting (D + W). The static closed chamber method was used to measure CH4 and N2O fluxes. Soil nitrate accumulated and N2O was emitted in treatments with soil drying. Nitrate disappeared while ammonium gradually increased after the soil was flooded during land preparation, indicating net nitrogen mineralization. N2O emissions were highest in both transition periods in D + W (437 and 645 {\textmu}g N2O m-2 h-1). Methane emissions were significant in only the F treatment. The highest global warming potential (GWP) in the transition between rice crops occurred in F, with CH4 contributing almost 100\% to the GWP. The GWP from other treatments was lower than F, with about 60--99\% of the GWP attributed to N2O emissions in treatments with soil drying. The GWP in the transition between rice crops represented up to 26\% of the total GWP from harvest to harvest. This study demonstrates that the transition period can be an important source of GHG emissions with relative importance of CH4 and N2O depending on the soil water regime. Therefore, the transition period should not be disregarded when estimating GHG emissions for rice cropping systems.},

The density decreased significantly by decay class and the range in density for decay classes was widest for the NFI decay classification system, suggesting this to be the most suitable. The C concentration in dead wood biomass increased with increasing decay class and in average Norway spruce (P. abies) showed a lower C concentration than Scots pine (P. sylvestris).

Manipulation of rice floodwater may offer a means of mitigating methane emission from rice fields without reducing rice yields. To test methods for reducing methane emission, we applied four water management methods to rice fields planted on silty-clay soils near Beaumont, Texas. The four water treatments investigated were: normal permanent flood (46 days post planting), normal flood with mid- season drainage aeration, normal flood with multiple drainage aeration, and late flood (76 days post planting). Methane emission rates varied markedly with water regime, showing the lowest seasonal total emission (1.2 g m               -2               ) with a multiple-aeration treatment and the highest (14.9 g m               -2               ) with a late flood. Although the multiple- aeration water management treatment emitted 88\% less methane than the normal irrigation treatment and did not reduce rice yields, the multiple-aeration treatment did require 2.7 times more water than the 202 mm required by the normal floodwater treatment. A comparison of measured methane emission and production rates obtained from incubated soil cores indicated that, depending on time of season and flood condition, from zero to over 90\% of the methane produced was oxidized. The average amount of methane which was oxidized during times of high emission was 73.1 {\textpm} 13.7 percent of that produced.},

Schaefer               et al.               measured methane's carbon isotopic composition in samples collected over the past 35 years in order to constrain the cause of the pause. Lower thermogenic emissions or variations in the hydroxyldriven methane sink caused the plateau. Thermogenic emissions didn't resume to cause the subsequent rise. Instead, the ongoing rise is most likely due to biogenic sources, most notably agriculture.

Causes could be sink variability or a temporary reduction in industrial or climate-sensitive sources. We reconstructed the global history of [CH               4               ] and its stable carbon isotopes from ice cores, archived air, and a global network of monitoring stations. A box-model analysis suggests that diminishing thermogenic emissions, probably from the fossil-fuel industry, and/or variations in the hydroxyl CH               4               sink caused the [CH               4               ] plateau. Thermogenic emissions did not resume to cause the renewed [CH               4               ] rise after 2006, which contradicts emission inventories. Post-2006 source increases are predominantly biogenic, outside the Arctic, and arguably more consistent with agriculture than wetlands. If so, mitigating CH               4               emissions must be balanced with the need for food production.},

  abstract = {1. Linear regression models are an important statistical tool in evolutionary and ecological studies. Unfortunately, these models often yield some uninterpretable estimates and hypothesis tests, especially when models contain interactions or polynomial terms. Furthermore, the standard errors for treatment groups, although often of interest for including in a publication, are not directly available in a standard linear model. 2. Centring and standardization of input variables are simple means to improve the interpretability of regression coefficients. Further, refitting the model with a slightly modified model structure allows extracting the appropriate standard errors for treatment groups directly from the model. 3. Centring will make main effects biologically interpretable even when involved in interactions and thus avoids the potential misinterpretation of main effects. This also applies to the estimation of linear effects in the presence of polynomials. Categorical input variables can also be centred and this sometimes assists interpretation. 4. Standardization ( z -transformation) of input variables results in the estimation of standardized slopes or standardized partial regression coefficients. Standardized slopes are comparable in magnitude within models as well as between studies. They have some advantages over partial correlation coefficients and are often the more interesting standardized effect size. 5. The thoughtful removal of intercepts or main effects allows extracting treatment means or treatment slopes and their appropriate standard errors directly from a linear model. This provides a simple alternative to the more complicated calculation of standard errors from contrasts and main effects. 6. The simple methods presented here put the focus on parameter estimation (point estimates as well as confidence intervals) rather than on significance thresholds. They allow fitting complex, but meaningful models that can be concisely presented and interpreted. The presented methods can also be applied to generalised linear models (GLM) and linear mixed models.},

  abstract = {Soil microbial communities mediate the decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM). The amount of carbon (C) that is respired leaves the soil as CO2 (soil respiration) and causes one of the greatest fluxes in the global carbon cycle. How soil microbial communities will respond to global warming, however, is not well understood. To elucidate the effect of warming on the microbial community we analyzed soil from the soil warming experiment Achenkirch, Austria. Soil of a mature spruce forest was warmed by 4 {$^\circ$}C during snow-free seasons since 2004. Repeated soil sampling from control and warmed plots took place from 2008 until 2010. We monitored microbial biomass C and nitrogen (N). Microbial community composition was assessed by phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA) and by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of ribosomal RNA genes. Microbial metabolic activity was estimated by soil respiration to biomass ratios and RNA to DNA ratios. Soil warming did not affect microbial biomass, nor did warming affect the abundances of most microbial groups. Warming significantly enhanced microbial metabolic activity in terms of soil respiration per amount of microbial biomass C. Microbial stress biomarkers were elevated in warmed plots. In summary, the 4 {$^\circ$}C increase in soil temperature during the snow-free season had no influence on microbial community composition and biomass but strongly increased microbial metabolic activity and hence reduced carbon use efficiency. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Shorter periods of flooding and manipulation of fertilizer inputs affect belowground community composition, biomass and functioning. However, there have been no previous studies of how such shifts in rice field management might affect soil biota and decomposition. Our objective was to examine how crop diversification, which demands different moisture regimes and nitrogen inputs, influences belowground invertebrate assemblages and their contribution to the decomposition of crop residues.We conducted a litterbag experiment in lowland paddy fields at the experimental field sites of the DFG-ICON project (Laguna, the Philippines) that were either continuously flooded, had seasonally alternating wet and dry periods, or were continuously dry. Additionally, subplot treatments within these crop rotations included different N fertilizer management practices. At a total of 36 plots we used litterbags with two different mesh sizes to assess decomposition with and without fauna over a period of 72 days. Furthermore, we sampled soil microfauna and mesofauna in both the wet (rainy) and dry seasons.Although we found no correlation between faunal abundance and the contribution by invertebrates to rice straw decomposition, we found that soil water content was the decisive factor determining the activity of decomposer invertebrates as well as the composition and abundance of the soil fauna in fields with alternating cropping regimes. The impact of invertebrates on rice straw decomposition was higher under anaerobic than aerobic soil conditions which compensated for reduced microbial decay rates during periods of flooding. In contrast, microbial decomposition rates were higher under aerobic conditions, whereas invertebrates had no apparent effects on the mass loss of rice straw despite their higher abundance in dry fields. Our results demonstrate that invertebrates are essential for the effective decay of rice straw residues under flooded soil conditions, and therefore play an important role in supplying nutrients to flooded rice.},

We investigated the hypothesis that the duration of a habitat following disturbance mediates the relative importance of physical and biotic control. We combined detailed information on natural populations in a series of temporary ponds with small-scale experiments on specific processes. We compared data on presence/absence and abundance of taxa from temporary ponds showing a gradient of habitat duration with 3 simple models of community structure that incorporate random forces, life history adaptations, and biotic interactions, respectively. Different scales of resolution in describing community structure provide different emphases on which processes are important in these communities. The Life History Model explained patterns of presence/absence in the ponds, but not patterns of abundance of many taxa which best fit a model in which the importance of predation and competition in structuring communities increases with increasing duration. Experimental studies confirmed that the effect of predation and competition in temporary pond communities depends on habitat duration. Predation on all prey species examined increased with increasing pond duration. Predators were more diverse and more abundant in long-duration ponds where effects of their consumption on the abundance of prey taxa were greater than in shorter-duration ponds. Predators from long-duration ponds fed preferentially on prey taxa that predominate in shorter-duration habitats such as Aedes mosquitoes and the fairy shrimp Eubranchipus. Competition between Daphnia and rotifers occurred primarily in intermediate-duration ponds, where Daphnia at typical densities was capable of drastically reducing abundances of Keratella cochlearis in cultures. However, at densities found in both short- and long-duration habitats, Daphnia had no effect.},

Although oxygen is required by the MOB for the first step of methane oxidation, their occurrence in anoxic lake waters has raised the possibility that they are capable of oxidizing methane further anaerobically. Here, we investigate the activity and growth of MOB in Lake Zug, a permanently stratified freshwater lake. The rates of anaerobic methane oxidation in the anoxic hypolimnion reached up to 0.2 {\textmu}M d-1. Single-cell nanoSIMS measurements, together with metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses, linked the measured rates to MOB of the order Methylococcales. Interestingly, their methane assimilation activity was similar under hypoxic and anoxic conditions. Our data suggest that these MOB use fermentation-based methanotrophy as well as denitrification under anoxic conditions, thus offering an explanation for their widespread presence in anoxic habitats such as stratified water columns. Thus, the methane sink capacity of anoxic basins may have been underestimated by not accounting for the anaerobic MOB activity.},

We used a spatially extensive sampling approach across salinity gradients and management regimes (disturbed, restored, and reference) in 22 wetland sites across two Oregon, USA estuaries, Tillamook and Coos Bays, to measure fluxes of methane (CH4), ecosystem respiration as carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O) over 1 year and related them to environmental forcing variables. Boosted regression tree (BRT) models explained drivers of GHG fluxes reasonably well despite highly nonlinear and interactive relationships and many flux measurements below detection. We used the BRT models to predict annual GHG fluxes in a subset of restored and reference sites where continuous environmental data were recorded and compared them to previously published soil carbon sequestration rates. Most sites had net removal of CO2-equivalents from the atmosphere over both 20 and 100 year timeframes. Our results show that a spatially extensive GHG flux sampling scheme and machine-learning statistical techniques can be used to estimate GHG fluxes in other current and former wetlands within the region if environmental data are collected at a spatial resolution that reflects site variability and at sufficient duration to reflect seasonality (i.e., at least one full year). Such an approach can save time and money in determining the feasibility of wetland restoration as a climate mitigation strategy. We use our results to suggest wetland restoration strategies that optimize climate benefits.},

  abstract = {Rice paddy soils have high organic carbon (OC) storage potential, but predicting OC stocks in these soils is difficult due to the complex OC stabilization mechanisms under fluctuating redox conditions. Especially in temperate climates, these mechanisms remain understudied and comparisons to OC stocks under natural vegetation are scarce. Semi-natural forests could have similar or higher OC inputs than rice paddies, but in the latter mineralization under anoxic conditions and interactions between OC and redox-sensitive minerals (in particular Fe oxyhydroxides, hereafter referred to as Fe oxides) could promote OC stabilization. Moreover, management-induced soil redox cycling in rice paddies can interact with pre-existing pedogenetic differences of soils having different degrees of evolution. To disentangle these drivers of soil OC stocks, we focused on a soil age gradient in Northern Italy with a long (30 + years) history of rice cultivation and remnant semi-natural forests. Irrespective of soil age, soils under semi-natural forest and paddy land-use showed comparable OC stocks. While, in topsoil, stocks of crystalline Fe and short-ranged Fe and Al oxides did not differ between land-uses, under paddy management more OC was found in the mineral-associated fraction. This hints to a stronger redox-driven OC stabilization in the paddy topsoil compared to semi-natural forest soils that might compensate for the presumed lower OC inputs under rice cropping. Despite the higher clay contents over the whole profile and more crystalline pedogenetic Fe stocks in the topsoil in older soils, OC stocks were higher in the younger soils, in particular in the 50--70 cm layer, where short-range ordered pedogenetic oxides were also more abundant. These patterns might be explained by differences in hydrological flows responsible for the translocation of Fe and dissolved OC to the subsoil, preferentially in the younger, coarse-textured soils. Taken together, these results indicate the importance of the complex interplay between redox-cycling affected by paddy-management and soil-age related hydrological properties.},

This may be due to group-ing of subjects, e.g., students within classrooms, or to repeated measurements on each subject over time or space, or to multiple related outcome measures at one point in time. Mixed model analysis provides a general, flexible approach in these situations, because it allows a wide variety of correlation patterns (or variance-covariance structures) to be explicitly modeled. As mentioned in chapter 14, multiple measurements per subject generally result in the correlated errors that are explicitly forbidden by the assumptions of standard (between-subjects) AN(C)OVA and regression models. While repeated measures analysis of the type found in SPSS, which I will call " classical repeated measures analysis " , can model general (multivariate approach) or spherical (univariate ap-proach) variance-covariance structures, they are not suited for other explicit struc-tures. Even more importantly, these repeated measures approaches discard all results on any subject with even a single missing measurement, while mixed mod-els allow other data on such subjects to be used as long as the missing data meets the so-called missing-at-random definition. Another advantage of mixed models is that they naturally handle uneven spacing of repeated measurements, whether in-tentional or unintentional. Also important is the fact that mixed model analysis is 357},

  abstract = {Stand structure was studied on thirty 1-ha plots in mature managed and old-growth forest stands dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) in southern Finland. The forests were classified into three categories (10 plots in each category) according to the age of the dominant spruces and signs of previous cutting: (1) mature managed (95-118 years), (2) overmature managed (124-145 years) and (3) old-growth (129-198 years). The average volume of the living trees was 299 m3/ha in mature, 331 m3/ha in overmature and 396 m3/ha in old-growth stands. The clearest difference in the living stand characteristics between the categories was in the numbers of large pines (Pinus sylvestris L.) and deciduous trees, which were both ca. 10 times more frequent in old-growth than in mature stands, and intermediate in overmature stands. The average volume of coarse woody debris (CWD) with a minimum diameter of 5 cm was 14 m3/ha in mature (range 2-28 m3/ha), 22 m3/ha in overmature (7-38 m3/ha) and 111 m3/ha (70-184 m3/ha) in old-growth stands. Stand age and basal area of the cut stumps together explained over 70\% of the variation in the volume of CWD. In old-growth forests, ca. 70\% of the volume of CWD consisted of logs, 23\% of intact dead standing trees and 7\% of broken snags. Most of the volume of CWD belonged to the 20-29 and 30-39 cm diameter classes, but the mean proportion of large trunks {$\geq$}40 cm was also considerable, 24\%. In managed forests man-made CWD, consisting of cut stumps, bolts and logging residues, accounted for an average of 25\% of the total volume of CWD. In many cases most of the CWD volume belonged to the small diameter classes, 5-9 and 10-19 cm, and the mean proportion of large trunks was only 8\%. We suggest that, considering the low proportion of both old-growth and overmature forests in southern Finland and the long time required for old-growth characteristics to develop, the most efficient short-term management strategy to increase structural diversity and old-growth attributes in managed forests would be to apply harvesting methods retaining the old-growth characteristics (i.e. large living trees, snags and logs) that already exist in overmature and mature stands.

  abstract = {Global climate change is predicted to intensify temperature and precipitation extremes, exposing soils to frequent and/or intense alternate wetting and drying regimes. Rewetting a dry soil causes a burst of CO2 known as the ``Birch effect''. This spike in respiration can be attributed to: (i) release of cellular solutes (metabolites) accumulated during drought due to rapid increase in water potential upon re-wetting; (ii) sudden death of certain microbes serving as carbon (C) sources for surviving microbes, leading to microbial community shifts; and (iii) release of physically protected C due to aggregate breakdown upon repeated drying-wetting. The relative importance of these mechanisms may change in different soil textures, but very few studies examine all three processes. In this study, we evaluated the effects of repeated drying and wetting cycles (transient state moisture conditions) on the Birch effect and elucidated the mechanisms that contributed to this effect in different textured soils. Soils of three distinct textures (sandy, loamy, and clayey) were incubated for 140 days under five alternate cycles of drying (10\% WHC) and wetting (100\% WHC) conditions. Control soils were held at 55\% WHC for the same duration. Microbial biomass C (MBC), extractable organic C (EOC), metabolites, microbial community structure, and changes in aggregate associated C were determined at each time point. Sandy soil had the lowest respiration rate followed by loamy and clayey soils, and cumulative CO2 loss was higher under transient moisture state compared to steady state. In sandy and clayey soils, changes in bacterial abundance controlled the Birch effect, while in loamy soil, the release of aggregate protected C majorly controlled the Birch effect.},

Changes in CH 4 and N 2 O emissions can substantially alter the overall greenhouse gas balance of a system. Drainage of peatlands for agriculture or forestry generally increases N 2 O emission as well as that of CO 2 , but also decreases CH 4 emission. Intermittent drainage or late flooding of rice paddies can greatly diminish the seasonal emission of CH 4 compared with continuous flooding. Changes in N 2 O emissions following land use change from forest or grassland to agriculture vary between climatic zones, and the net impact varies with time. In many soils, the increase in carbon sequestration by adopting no-till systems may be largely negated by associated increases in N 2 O emission. The promotion of carbon credits for the no-till system before we have better quantification of its net greenhouse gas balance is na{\"i}ve. Applying nitrogen fertilizers to forests could increase the forest carbon sink, but may be accompanied by a net increase in N 2 O; conversely, adding lime to acid forest soils can decrease the N 2 O emission.},

Agricultural soils may also act as a sink or source for CO 2, but the net flux is small. Many agricultural practices can potentially mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the most prominent of which are improved cropland and grazing land management and restoration of degraded lands and cultivated organic soils. Lower, but still significant mitigation potential is provided by water and rice management, set-aside, land use change and agroforestry, livestock management and manure management. The global technical mitigation potential from agriculture (excluding fossil fuel offsets from biomass) by 2030, considering all gases, is estimated to be approximately 5500-6000Mt CO2-eq.yr-1, with economic potentials of approximately 1500-1600, 2500-2700 and 4000-4300Mt CO2-eq.yr -1 at carbon prices of up to 20, up to 50 and up to 100 US\vphantom\{\} t CO2-eq.-1, respectively. In addition, GHG emissions could be reduced by substitution of fossil fuels for energy production by agricultural feedstocks (e.g. crop residues, dung and dedicated energy crops).

Reducing greenhouse emissions to limit warming to less than 1.5 or 2{$^\circ$}C above preindustrial levels, as outlined in the Paris Agreement, can yield strong co-benefits for land, freshwater and marine biodiversity and reduce amplifying climate feedbacks from ecosystem changes. Not all climate mitigation strategies are equally effective at producing biodiversity co-benefits, some in fact are counterproductive. Moreover, social implications are often overlooked within the climate-biodiversity nexus. Protecting biodiverse and carbon-rich natural environments, ecological restoration of potentially biodiverse and carbon-rich habitats, the deliberate creation of novel habitats, taking into consideration a locally adapted and meaningful (i.e. full consequences considered) mix of these measures, can result in the most robust win-win solutions. These can be further enhanced by avoidance of narrow goals, taking long-term views and minimizing further losses of intact ecosystems. In this review paper, we first discuss various climate mitigation actions that evidence demonstrates can negatively impact biodiversity, resulting in unseen and unintended negative consequences. We then examine climate mitigation actions that co-deliver biodiversity and societal benefits. We give examples of these win-win solutions, categorized as `protect, restore, manage and create', in different regions of the world that could be expanded, upscaled and used for further innovation.},

  abstract = {While rice production may need to increase to keep pace with the growing demand, efficient and sustainable management is needed to mitigate methane emissions from rice paddy fields, which still contribute substantially to the global methane budget. Field mid-season drainage is a popular water management strategy that reduces emissions by shortening the period of time the field spends in anaerobic conditions; however, it is still unclear how drainage timing affects its overall effectiveness. Here we combine observations from field experiments with a methane emission model to analyze how the time at which the field is drained controls the reduction in methane emissions. We show that an optimal drainage timing maximizes the mitigation efficiency of the drainage, defined as the reduction in methane emissions due to a mid-season drainage relative to the emissions in a continuous flooding management. We then estimate maximum mitigation efficiencies and optimal drainage timings across the experiments and shed light on the role of organic amendment. The average optimal drainage timing for organically amended fields is earlier than for non-amended ones (20 and 50 days after transplanting, respectively), promoting an average CH4 emissions reduction of about 45\% and 35\%, respectively. The potential increase in mitigation efficiency obtained by optimizing drainage timing highlights the important role of this strategy in a sustainable management of rice cultivation, where rice yield and N2O emissions may impose further constraints on water management.},

The aim of this study was to assess species-specific dead wood density (DWD) and carbon content (CC) per decay class for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.), silver birch or downy birch (Betula pendula Roth or Betula pubescens Ehrh.), European aspen (Populus tremula L.), grey alder (Alnus incana (L.) Moench), black alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn.), common oak (Quercus robur L.) and European ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.), as the main representative hemiboreal forest tree species. The study findings revealed that mean DWD significantly decreased, while mean CC slightly increased during the wood decomposition process, which led to carbon density (CD) reduction over five decay classes. The mean CC showed little variation among the eight tree species and ranged between 47 and 54\%. The lower CDs in the dead wood of decay classes 1 and 2 were more associated with coniferous than deciduous species. The estimated CD significantly decreased in all species with increasing decay class. Dead wood at decay class 5 of Scots pine, silver or downy birch, European ash and common oak had the highest CD, followed by Norway spruce and grey alder, and the lowest CDs were obtained for European aspen and black alder.},

Implementing these practices may also yield additional benefits for farmers and society besides GHG emissions mitigation. This study employs a conceptual framework to quantify the co-benefits of adopting BWMPs in a corn agroecosystem in eastern Canada. The assessment combines financial analysis and life cycle assessment to compare the implementation of BWMPs with the Base technology. This study was based on field experiments for corn production under BWMPs and Base technology during the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons in St. Emmanuel, Quebec. Co-benefits were estimated by calculating the differences in net present value and environmental costs resulting from implementing BWMPs compared with Base technology. The findings show that co-benefits range from \$129.42 to \$142.03 per hectare under median environmental prices and \$158,29 to \$231.74 per hectare under upper environmental prices for a 20-year life expectancy of BWMPs implementation. In conclusion, this study underscores the significance of understanding the co-benefits associated with the innovative water management system, as it supports climate change mitigation and adaptation measures at the farm scale. The positive co-benefits highlight the economic and social advantages of implementing BWMPs alongside GHG emission mitigation. Nevertheless, these co-benefits may not be sufficient to encourage voluntary adoption among farmers. Therefore, policymakers should consider implementing supportive policy instruments like green payments and extension activities to facilitate the adoption of BWMPs.},

We explore how climate and land use impact multiple soil function simultaneously, employing two datasets: (1) observational -- 456 samples from the European Land Use/Land Cover Area Frame Survey; and (2) experimental -- 80 samples from Germany's Global Change Experimental Facility. We aim to investigate whether manipulative field experiment results align with observable climate, land use, and soil multifunctionality trends across Europe, measuring seven ecosystem functions to calculate soil multifunctionality. The observational data showed Europe-wide declines in soil multifunctionality under rising temperatures and dry conditions, worsened by cropland management. Our experimental data confirmed these relationships, suggesting that changes in climate will reduce soil multifunctionality across croplands and grasslands. Land use changes from grasslands to croplands threaten the integrity of soil systems, and enhancing soil multifunctionality in arable systems is key to maintain multifunctionality in a changing climate.},

  abstract = {Traditional transplanted rice with continuous standing water in Asia has relatively high water inputs. Because of increasing water scarcity, there is a need to develop alternative systems that require less water. This paper reports results of on-farm experiments in the Philippines to reduce water input by water-saving irrigation techniques and alternative crop establishment methods, such as wet and dry seeding. With continuous standing water, direct wet-seeded rice yielded higher than traditional transplanted rice by 3--17\%, required 19\% less water during the crop growth period and increased water productivity by 25--48\%. Direct dry-seeded rice yielded the same as transplanted and wetseeded rice, but can make more effective use of early season rainfall in the wet season and save irrigation water for the subsequent dry season. Direct seeding can further reduce water input by shortening the land preparation period. In transplanted and wet-seeded rice, keeping the soil continuously around saturation reduced yields on average by 5\% and water inputs by 35\% and increased water productivity by 45\% compared with flooded conditions. Intermittent irrigation further reduced water inputs but at the expense of increased yield loss. Under water-saving irrigation, wet-seeded rice out-yielded transplanted rice by 6--36\% and was a suitable establishment method to save water and retain high yields. Groundwater depth greatly affected water use and the possibilities of saving water. With shallow groundwater tables of 10--20 cm depth, irrigation water requirements and potential water savings were low but yield reductions were relatively small. The introduction of water-saving technologies at the field level can have implications for the hydrology and water use at larger spatial scale levels. \# 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this review, we discuss current knowledge of carbon stocks in litter, deadwood and soil in Japan's forest sector. According to data from published reports and nationwide surveys, the carbon stock in forest litter is less than that indicated in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines for temperate and cool temperate forests; for example, coniferous species showed 4.4 Mg C ha)1 for Cryptomeria japonica and 3.1 Mg C ha)1 for Chamaecyparis obtusa, and broad-leaved species ranged from 3.5 Mg C ha)1 for Castanopsis spp. to 7.3 Mg C ha)1 for Fagus spp. For deadwood carbon stock, coniferous plantations with a record of non-commercial thinning showed 17.1 Mg C ha)1 and semi-natural broad-leaved forests showed 5.3 Mg C ha)1 on average, although only limited data were available. The black soil group (comparable to Andosols and Andisols) showed large carbon stocks in soil layers 0--30 cm deep (130 Mg C ha)1). The brown forest soil group (Cambisols and Inceptisols), occupying the most dominant area, showed a carbon stock of 87.0 Mg C ha)1 on average, which was similar to the data shown in the IPCC guidelines. In a comparison of land use between the forest sector and the agricultural sector for the same soil group, the carbon stock in the agricultural soil was 21\% lower and in the grassland soil it was 18\% higher than the stock in the forest soil. In this review, we also discuss issues for improving the estimation method and inventory of carbon stock in litter, deadwood and soil in Japan.},

Many biodiverse ecosystems are being lost at far higher rates than they are being protected or ecologically restored. At the same time, natural climate solutions offer opportunities to restore biodiversity while mitigating climate change. The Bonn Challenge is a U.N. programme to restore biodiversity and mitigate climate change through restoration of the world's degraded landscapes. It provides an unprecedented chance for ecological restoration to become a linchpin tool for addressing many environmental issues. Unfortunately, the Forest and Landscape Restoration programme that underpins the Bonn Challenge, as its name suggests, remains focused on trees and forests, despite rising evidence that many non-forest ecosystems also offer strong restoration potential for biodiversity and climate mitigation. We see a need for restoration to step back to be more inclusive of different ecosystem types and to step up to provide integrated scientific knowledge to inform large-scale restoration. Stepping back and up will require assessments of where to restore what species, with recognition that in many landscapes multiple habitat types should be restored. In the process, trade-offs in the delivery of different ecosystem services (e.g. carbon, biodiversity, water, albedo, livestock forage) should be clearly addressed. We recommend that biodiversity safeguards be included in policy and implemented in practice, to avoid undermining the biophysical relationships that provide ecosystem resilience to climate change. For ecological restoration to contribute to international policy goals will require integrated large-scale science that works across biome boundaries.},

  abstract = {Paddy rice cultivation is an important source of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions in China. The traditional flooded paddy rice fields not only use large amounts of irrigation water, but also produce significant methane (CH4) emissions. To balance food security with environmental impacts of rice production, many water-saving irrigations technologies have been tested in the field to increase the drainage period during the rice growth cycle. However, whether these management solutions can be implemented at the regional scale needs to be further explored. Because it is too time-consuming and resource-intensive for field experiments to be carried out across large areas, we opt to assess the regional impacts of alternative irrigation schemes via computer modeling, by coupling the well-known DSSAT and DNDC models, which have been extensively validated in China. Irrigation methods tested include the traditional Continuous Flooding (CF), Midseason Drainage (MD) and Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD). Simulation results show that compared with CF, water-saving irrigation methods can significantly reduce the CH4 emission from paddy rice field, with slight or no loss in expected rice yields. AWD had the greatest effect in reducing irrigation water amounts and CH4 emission. Compared with CF, CH4 emission under the AWD were 60\% - 71\% lower in Northeast China sites and 34\% - 65\% lower in South China sites. At the same time, compared to CF, irrigation water use in AWD was reduced by 23\% - 34\% in northeast China sites and by 18\% - 50\% in south China sites. Our results suggest that policies that support expansion of AWD in paddy rice cultivation across China can lead to a ``win-win'' for the food-water-GHG emissions tradeoffs, and offer a viable solution for policy makers and stakeholders in China.},

AWD effectively reduced water use compared to continuous flooding (CF) but did not significantly reduce rice grain yield and soil carbon content in all sites. Methane (CH4) emissions varied significantly among sites and seasons as affected by soil properties and water management. AWD reduced CH4 emissions relative to CF by 151 (25\%), 166 (37\%), 9 (31\%), and 22 (32\%) kg CH4 ha-1 season-1 in Hue, Jakenan, Prachin Buri, and Mu{\~n}oz, respectively. In Prachin Buri and Mu{\~n}oz, AWD reduced CH4 emissions only during the dry season. Site-specific CH4 emission factors (EFs) ranged 0.13--4.50 and 0.08--4.88 kg CH4 ha-1 d-1 under CF and AWD, respectively. The mean AWD scaling factors (SFs) was 0.69 (95\% confidence interval: 0.61--0.77), which is slightly higher than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)' SF for multiple aeration of 0.52 (error range: 0.41--0.66). Significant reductions in the global warming potential (GWP) of CH4+nitrous oxide (N2O) by AWD were observed in Hue and Jakenan (27.8 and 36.1\%, respectively), where the contributions of N2O to the total GWP were only 0.8 and 3.5\%, respectively. In Mu{\~n}oz, however, CH4 emission reduction through AWD was offset by the increase in N2O emissions. The results indicate that the IPCC's SF for multiple aeration may only be applied to irrigated rice fields where surface water level is controllable for a substantial period. This study underscores the importance of practical feasibility and appropriate timing of water management in successful GHG reductions by AWD.},

In order to calculate CWD stocks without information on thinning/harvesting dates, the development of a system of classifying CWD into five decay classes (DCs) is presented. DCs were based mainly on visual characteristics linked to the degree of decomposition. Samples were taken from thinned first rotation plantations to establish the basic density loss associated with each DC.

  abstract = {Meeting the reporting requirements of the Kyoto Protocol has focused attention on the potential of forests in sustainably sequestering carbon (C) to mitigate the effects of rising levels of atmospheric CO2. Much uncertainty remains concerning the ultimate effect of management on such sequestration effects. The management of woody debris (WD) and other deadwood stocks is an example of a management intervention with the scope of affecting the source-sink dynamics of forest C. Windrowing is the most commonly employed approach to the management of post-harvest WD. This study investigated the quantities of windrowed deadwood C across a chronosequence of reforested commercial Sitka spruce stands in Ireland and how its decomposition rate affected its contribution to forest C sequestration. The C stocks in windrowed WD ranged from 25 to 8 t C ha-1 at the 4-and 16-year-old stands, respectively. Losses due to the decomposition of these stocks ranged from 5.15 t C ha-1 yr-1 at the youngest site (4 years old) to 0.68 t C ha-1 yr-1 at the oldest site (16 years old). Using a visual decay-class categorization of WD components and an assessment of wood density, decay rate constants were estimated for logs, branches, and stumps (the main WD constituents of windrows) as 0.037, 0.038, and 0.044, respectively. These results, derived from stand stock evaluations, were placed into context with data previously published from the same chrono-sequence that characterized the day-to-day fluxes to or from this pool. This comparison indicated that though only a very small quantity of C was lost in dissolved leachate form, the most significant pathway for loss was respiratory and ranged from 16 to 8 t C ha-1 yr-1 at the 9-and 16-year-old sites. These estimates were many times greater in extent than estimates made using a density-loss ap-proach, the difference indicating that fragmentation and weathering play a large role in woody decomposition in intensively managed forests.},

Drawing on a case study in the East Usambara Mountains, Tanzania, we compare the impacts of CSA with other agricultural management practices on invertebrate pest and natural enemy diversity, and the associated effects on crop damage and crop yield. We found that the most common CSA practices in the region, terracing and trenching with live and compost mulches, provided the best outcomes for crop production, pest suppression and agricultural income. However, greater diversity of pests was observed when neighboring fields planted improved crop varieties, suggesting that the use of improved varieties by farmers creates increased vulnerability to pest damage among neighboring farmers that used local varieties. Also, greater natural enemy diversity was found when neighboring fields were either intercropped or left fallow highlighting spatial flows of ecosystem services between fields. Landcover heterogeneity was positively correlated with pest diversity, whilst landcover richness was positively associated with higher pest volume, highlighting the importance of landscape characteristics in pest and natural enemy dynamics. Finally, we found that crop damage was most severe when pest communities had low species richness, suggesting that a small number of key crop pests contribute to most yield losses. Our findings illustrate that those varied combinations of agricultural management practices lead to heterogeneous biodiversity outcomes and trade-offs, and highlight the importance of local management, neighborhood effects and landscape characteristics. CSA evaluations must therefore look beyond productivity as a measure for success, as trade-offs with invertebrate biodiversity, food production, and environmental sustainability often interact and feedback in complex and unexpected ways.},

  abstract = {Ecologists widely agree that species diversity consists of two components, richness (the number of species) and evenness (a measure of the equitability of the proportional abundances of those species). However, no consensus on an exact definition of evenness (or equitability) has emerged. Instead, numerous equitability indices have been used in the ecological literature, as different researchers have preferred indices with different mathematical properties. In this paper, I show that the phrase 'species diversity consists of two independent components, richness and evenness' logically leads to one particular definition of evenness (Evenness = Diversity/Richness). To facilitate accurate communication, I propose that the term 'evenness' be used only to refer to this phenomenon, and that other terms be used for the equitability indices that measure other things. Here I provide a review of popular equitability indices, explain what each measures in practice, and show how they relate to each other and to evenness itself. I also explore how the partitioning of diversity into richness and evenness components is related to the partitioning of diversity into alpha and beta components. Dissecting the indices makes it easier to see the conceptual differences among them. Such understanding is necessary to ensure that an appropriate index is chosen for the questions at hand, as well as to interpret the index values correctly and to assess when index values can and when they cannot be considered comparable. {\copyright} 2012 The Authors.

  abstract = {Rice production in Asia needs to increase to feed a growing population. Though a complete assessment of the level of water scarcity in Asian rice production is still lacking, there are signs that declining quality of water and declining availability of water resources are threatening the sustainability of the irrigated rice-based production system. Drought is one of the main constraints for high yield in rain-fed rice. Exploring ways to produce more rice with less water is essential for food security and sustaining environmental health in Asia. This chapter reviews the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI)'s integrated approach, using genetics, breeding and integrated resource management to increase rice yield and to reduce water demand for rice production. Water-saving irrigation, such as saturated-soil culture and alternate wetting and drying, can drastically cut down the unproductive water outflows and increase water productivity. However, these technologies mostly lead to some yield decline in the current lowland rice varieties. Other new approaches are being researched to increase water productivity without sacrifice in yield. These include the incorporation of the C4 photosynthetic pathway into rice to increase rice yield per unit water transpired, the use of molecular biotechnology to enhance drought-stress tolerance and the development of `aerobic rice', to achieve high and sustainable yields in non-flooded soil. Through the adoption of water-saving irrigation technologies, rice land will shift away from being continuously anaerobic to being partly or even completely aerobic. These shifts will have profound changes in water conservation, soil organic-matter turnover, nutrient dynamics, carbon sequestration, soil productivity, weed ecology and greenhouse-gas emissions. Whereas some of these changes can be perceived as positive, e.g. water conservation and decreased methane emission, some are perceived as negative, e.g. release of nitrous oxide from the soil and decline in soil organic matter. The challenge will be to develop effective integrated natural-resource-management interventions, which allow profitable rice cultivation with increased soil aeration, while maintaining the productivity, environmental services and sustainability of rice-based ecosystems.},

  abstract = {A substantial part of the Earths' soil organic carbon (SOC) is stored in Arctic permafrost peatlands, which represent large potential sources for increased emissions of the greenhouse gases CH 4 and CO 2 in a warming climate. The microbial communities and their genetic repertoire involved in the breakdown and mineralisation of SOC in these soils are, however, poorly understood. In this study, we applied a combined metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approach on two Arctic peat soils to investigate the identity and the gene pool of the microbiota driving the SOC degradation in the seasonally thawed active layers. A large and diverse set of genes encoding plant polymer-degrading enzymes was found, comparable to microbiotas from temperate and subtropical soils. This indicates that the metabolic potential for SOC degradation in Arctic peat is not different from that of other climatic zones. The majority of these genes were assigned to three bacterial phyla, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Bacteroidetes. Anaerobic metabolic pathways and the fraction of methanogenic archaea increased with peat depth, evident for a gradual transition from aerobic to anaerobic lifestyles. A population of CH 4-oxidising bacteria closely related to Methylobacter tundripaludum was the dominating active group of methanotrophs. Based on the in-depth characterisation of the microbes and their genes, we conclude that these Arctic peat soils will turn into CO 2 sources owing to increased active layer depth and prolonged growing season. However, the extent of future CH 4 emissions will critically depend on the response of the methanotrophic bacteria. {\copyright} 2013 International Society for Microbial Ecology.},

  abstract = {Methanotrophs oxidize most of the methane (CH4) produced in natural and anthropogenic ecosystems. Often living close to soil surfaces, these microorganisms must frequently adjust to temperature change. While many environmental studies have addressed temperature effects on CH4 oxidation and methanotrophic communities, there is little knowledge about the physiological adjustments that underlie these effects. We have studied thermal acclimation in Methylobacter, a widespread, abundant, and environmentally important methanotrophic genus. Comparisons of growth and CH4 oxidation kinetics at different temperatures in three members of the genus demonstrate that temperature has a strong influence on how much CH4 is consumed to support growth at different CH4 concentrations. However, the temperature effect varies considerably between species, suggesting that how a methanotrophic community is composed influences the temperature effect on CH4 uptake. To understand thermal acclimation mechanisms widely we carried out a transcriptomics experiment with Methylobacter tundripaludum SV96T. We observed, at different temperatures, how varying abundances of transcripts for glycogen and protein biosynthesis relate to cellular glycogen and ribosome concentrations. Our data also demonstrated transcriptional adjustment of CH4 oxidation, oxidative phosphorylation, membrane fatty acid saturation, cell wall composition, and exopolysaccharides between temperatures. In addition, we observed differences in M. tundripaludum SV96T cell sizes at different temperatures. We conclude that thermal acclimation in Methylobacter results from transcriptional adjustment of central metabolism, protein biosynthesis, cell walls and storage. Acclimation leads to large shifts in CH4 consumption and growth efficiency, but with major differences between species. Thus, our study demonstrates that physiological adjustments to temperature change can substantially influence environmental CH4 uptake rates and that consideration of methanotroph physiology might be vital for accurate predictions of warming effects on CH4 emissions.},

This review fills in this gap by providing comprehensive methodological guidance on the quantification of co-impacts and their integration into climate-related decision making based on the literature. The article first clarifies the confusion in the literature about related terms and makes a proposal for a more consistent terminological framework, then emphasizes the importance of working in a multiple-objective--multiple-impact framework. It creates a taxonomy of co-impacts and uses this to propose a methodological framework for the identification of the key co-impacts to be assessed for a given climate policy and to avoid double counting. It reviews the different methods available to quantify and monetize different co-impacts and introduces three methodological frameworks that can be used to integrate these results into decision making. On the basis of an initial assessment of selected studies, it also demonstrates that the incorporation of co-impacts can significantly change the outcome of economic assessments. Finally, the review calls for major new research and innovation toward simplified evaluation methods and streamlined tools for more widely applicable appraisals of co-impacts for decision making.},

  abstract = {Robust sub-seasonal and seasonal drought forecasts are essential for water managers and stakeholders coping with water shortage. Many studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance of hydrological forecasts, that is, streamflow. Nevertheless, only few studies evaluated the performance of hydrological drought forecasts. The objective of this study, therefore, is to analyse the skill and robustness of meteorological and hydrological drought forecasts on a catchment scale (the Ter and Llobregat rivers in Catalonia, Spain), rather than on a continental or global scale. Meteorological droughts were forecasted using downscaled (5 km) probabilistic weather reforecasts (ECMWF-SEAS4). These downscaled data were also used to produce hydrological drought forecasts, derived from time series of streamflow data simulated with a hydrological model (LISFLOOD). This resulted in seasonal hydro-meteorological reforecasts with a lead time up to 7 months, for the time period 2002--2010. These monthly reforecasts were compared to two datasets: (1) droughts derived from a proxy for observed data, including gridded precipitation data and discharge simulated by the LISFLOOD model, fed by these gridded climatological data; and (2) droughts derived from in situ observed precipitation and discharge. Results showed that the skill of hydrological drought forecasts is higher than the climatology, up to 3--4 months lead time. On the contrary, meteorological drought forecasts, analysed using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), do not show added value for short accumulation times (SPI1 and SPI3). The robustness analysis showed that using either a less extreme or a more extreme threshold leads to a large change in forecasting skill, which points at a rather low robustness of the hydrological drought forecasts. Because the skill found in hydrological drought forecasts is higher than the meteorological ones in this case study, the use of hydrological drought forecasts in Catalonia is highly recommended for management of water resources.},

Establishment of forests in these grasslands, savannas, and open-canopy woodlands would devastate biodiversity and ecosystem services. Such undesired outcomes are avoidable if the distinct ecologies and conservation needs of forest and grassy biomes become better integrated into science and policy.

Precipitation data from 199 stations spanning the period 1851--2018 were employed, following homogenisation, to derive SPI-3 and SPI-12 series for each station, together with indices on drought duration and severity. Results reveal a general absence of statistically significant long-term trends in the study domain, with the exception of significant trends at some stations, generally covering short periods. The largest decreasing trends in SPI-3 (i.e., increasing drought conditions) were found for summer in the British and Irish Isles. In general, drought episodes experienced in the last two or three decades have precedents during the last 170{$\cdot$}years, emphasizing the importance of long records for assessing change. The main characteristic of drought variability in Western Europe is its strong spatial diversity, with regions exhibiting a homogeneous temporal evolution. Notably, the temporal variability of drought in Western Europe is more dominant than long-term trends. This suggests that long-term drought trends cannot be confirmed in Western Europe using precipitation records alone. This study provides a long-term regional assessment of drought variability in Western Europe, which can contribute to better understanding of regional climate change during the past two centuries.},

One such driver, drought, is increasing in severity and frequency due to climate change. Further, legacy effects, or long-lasting impacts after drought has subsided, could have lasting impacts on the soil microbiome with important consequences for ecosystem functioning. Thus, our study aimed to understand how the soil microbiome responds after a severe, prolonged drought and whether legacy effects persist post-drought. We measured soil microbial community response in a mesic grassland for two years after a four-year experimental drought in a native tallgrass prairie. The experimental drought was imposed either (1) chronically by reducing each growing season rainfall event by 66\% or (2) intensely by completely eliminating growing season rainfall until an {$\sim$}45\% reduction in mean annual rainfall (climatic average) was achieved. The bacterial community showed no legacies in the first season post-drought in response to either chronic or intense drought but showed an increased abundance of Verrucomicrobia and decreased richness in both treatments in the second growing season after the drought treatments ended. In the first and second post-drought growing seasons, we found small differences in beta diversity between the control and intense drought treatment for fungal communities but not for the chronic drought treatment. Further, we found that the two main phyla of fungi, Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, showed reduced relative abundance post-drought in the intense drought treatment. Overall, few legacies in soil microbial communities persisted after a four-year experimentally induced drought. However, our results show that the nature of the drought---chronic versus intense---can differentially impact fungal versus bacterial short-term legacies. These results suggest that the soil microbiome is for the most part drought resistant (responds little during drought) and/or resilient (quickly recovers post-drought, since a study at the same site found that drought impacted the bacterial community) in this mesic grassland.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Bacterial community dynamics and biodegradation processes were examined in a highly creosote-contaminated soil undergoing a range of laboratory-based bioremediation treatments. The dynamics of the eubacterial community, the number of heterotrophs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) degraders, and the total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) and PAH concentrations were monitored during the bioremediation process. TPH and PAHs were significantly degraded in all treatments (72 to 79\% and 83 to 87\%, respectively), and the biodegradation values were higher when nutrients were not added, especially for benzo(               a               )anthracene and chrysene. The moisture content and aeration were determined to be the key factors associated with PAH bioremediation. Neither biosurfactant addition, bioaugmentation, nor ferric octate addition led to differences in PAH or TPH biodegradation compared to biodegradation with nutrient treatment. All treatments resulted in a high first-order degradation rate during the first 45 days, which was markedly reduced after 90 days. A sharp increase in the size of the heterotrophic and PAH-degrading microbial populations was observed, which coincided with the highest rates of TPH and PAH biodegradation. At the end of the incubation period, PAH degraders were more prevalent in samples to which nutrients had not been added. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis and principal-component analysis confirmed that there was a remarkable shift in the composition of the bacterial community due to both the biodegradation process and the addition of nutrients. At early stages of biodegradation, the {$\alpha$}-               Proteobacteria               group (genera               Sphingomonas               and               Azospirillum               ) was the dominant group in all treatments. At later stages, the {$\gamma$}-               Proteobacteria               group (genus               Xanthomonas               ), the {$\alpha$}-               Proteobacteria               group (genus               Sphingomonas               ), and the               Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides               group (               Bacteroidetes               ) were the dominant groups in the nonnutrient treatment, while the {$\gamma$}-               Proteobacteria               group (genus               Xathomonas               ), the {$\beta$}-               Proteobacteria               group (genera               Alcaligenes               and               Achromobacter               ), and the {$\alpha$}-               Proteobacteria               group (genus               Sphingomonas               ) were the dominant groups in the nutrient treatment. This study shows that specific bacterial phylotypes are associated both with different phases of PAH degradation and with nutrient addition in a preadapted PAH-contaminated soil. Our findings also suggest that there are complex interactions between bacterial species and medium conditions that influence the biodegradation capacity of the microbial communities involved in bioremediation processes.},

  abstract = {While there is much debate on transformative change among academics and policymakers, the discussion on how to govern such change is still in its infancy. This article argues that transformative governance is needed to enable the transformative change necessary for achieving global sustainability goals. Based on a literature review, the article unpacks this concept of transformative governance. It is: integrative, to ensure local solutions also have sustainable impacts elsewhere (across scales, places, issues and sectors); inclusive, to empower those whose interests are currently not being met and represent values embodying transformative change for sustainability; adaptive, enabling learning, experimentation, and reflexivity, to cope with the complexity of transformative change; and pluralist, recognizing different knowledge systems. We argue that only when these four governance approaches are: implemented in conjunction; operationalized in a specific manner; and focused on addressing the indirect drivers underlying sustainability issues, governance becomes transformative.},

  abstract = {Objective: The objective of this study was to provide a holistic evaluation of AWD adoption in temperate rice cropping systems, including associated trade-offs. We hypothesized that the adoption of AWD in water seeded rice paddies can reduce the global warming potential (GWP) without affecting plant N uptake or introducing yield gaps, and also maintain a high quality of rice grain by limiting the uptake of metal(loid)s present in the soil, thereby resulting in an overall positive agro-environmental performance. Methods: In a two-year field experiment in NW Italy two alternative irrigation practices involving water seeding followed by AWD management of different severity (AWDsafe and AWDstrong) were evaluated relative to the conventional water seeding and continuous flooding (WFL), comparing three different rice varieties. Yields and yield components, plant N uptake, apparent N recovery (ANR), metal(loid) concentrations in grain, and CH4 and N2O emissions were evaluated. Results: AWDsafe and AWDstrong maintained or increased yields compared to WFL depending on varieties, despite an increase in sterility. There were no consistent differences in N uptake and ANR. Both AWDsafe and AWDstrong significantly reduce As concentration in grain, but significantly increase Cd and nickel (Ni). AWDsafe and AWDstrong reduced CH4 emissions by 45--55 \% and 40--73 \%, respectively, compared toWFL, while no increase in N2O emissions was observed. This resulted in a reduction in the GWP of 46 and 54 \% with AWDsafe and AWDstrong, respectively. Conclusions and Implications: AWD was shown to be effective for mitigating GHG emissions from temperate rice cropping systems while maintaining high yield performance comparable or higher than WFL. AWD may represent a viable alternative to continuous flooding to improve agro-environmental sustainability of temperate rice cropping systems, but the trade-off between decreasing As and increasing Cd and Ni contents in the grain may represent an important concern for food safety with the adoption of this alternative water management practice.},

Based on morphology, larvae isolated from 11 samples of these naturally infected snails preliminarily were identified as A. cantonensis. Comparison of partial nucleotide sequences of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene revealed that four sequences are identical to A. cantonensis haplotype ac4 from Bangkok and the other seven to that of A. cantonensis isolate AC Thai, indicating two independent lineages of A. cantonensis in Thailand.},

So far, most studies have focused on the ecological consequences of above-ground biodiversity loss; yet a large part of Earth's biodiversity is literally hidden below ground. Whether reductions of biodiversity in soil communities below ground have consequences for the overall performance of an ecosystem remains unresolved. It is important to investigate this in view of recent observations that soil biodiversity is declining and that soil communities are changing upon land use intensification. We established soil communities differing in composition and diversity and tested their impact on eight ecosystem functions in model grassland communities. We show that soil biodiversity loss and simplification of soil community composition impair multiple ecosystem functions, including plant diversity, decomposition, nutrient retention, and nutrient cycling. The average response of all measured ecosystem functions (ecosystem multifunctionality) exhibited a strong positive linear relationship to indicators of soil biodiversity, suggesting that soil community composition is a key factor in regulating ecosystem functioning. Our results indicate that changes in soil communities and the loss of soil biodiversity threaten ecosystem multifunctionality and sustainability.},

Many stream-dwelling insects exploit the physical characteristics of streams to obtain their foods. As consumers at intermediate trophic levels, macroinvertebrates are influenced by both bottom-up and top-down forces in streams and serve as the conduits by which these effects are propagated. Macroinvertebrates can have an important influence on nutrient cycles, primary productivity, decomposition, and translocation of materials. Interactions among macroinvertebrates and their food resources vary among functional groups. Macroinvertebrates constitute an important source of food for numerous fish, and unless outside energy subsidies are greater than in-stream food resources for fish, effective fisheries management must account for fish-invertebrate linkages and macroinvertebrate linkages with resources and habitats. Macroinvertebrates also serve as valuable indicators of stream degradation. The many roles performed by stream-dwelling macroinvertebrates underscore the importance of their conservation.},

A small decrease in pH resulting from the introduction of acidic materials significantly decreased CH4 production. A slight increase in soil pH however, resulted in an enhancement of CH4 production.

Here, we demonstrate a large effect of temperature on rice grain yield when solar radiation and crop growth duration were not confounding factors for explaining yield difference across two locations in the tropical and subtropical environments. We found that grain yield of double-season rice crops in the subtropical environment of Wuxue County, Hubei Province, China was 9--66\% higher than that in the tropical environment of International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Philippines. Such yield difference was not caused by the difference in crop growth duration from transplanting to maturity. Biomass production rather than harvest index was responsible for the yield difference. Average daily minimum and maximum temperature from transplanting to maturity at IRRI was 3.4 and 1.9 {$^\circ$}C higher than that at Wuxue, respectively, whereas average daily solar radiation at Wuxue was lower or similar to that at IRRI. Crop's efficiency in converting solar radiation into biomass (i.e. radiation use efficiency, RUE) at Wuxue was 48\% higher than that at IRRI, which was associated with the difference in temperature between the two environments. We concluded that lower rice yield in the tropical environment was associated with lower RUE, which was due to the higher temperature compared with the subtropical environment. Our results suggested the crop adaptation strategies for global climate changes should focus more on future warming.},

Agriculture, despite being the source of nearly 25\% of net emissions, has not commonly been capped. But it has been mentioned as voluntary source of net emission offsets. Such offsets could arise from action reducing GHG emissions, enhancing sequestration, or producing feedstocks for low emitting bioenergy replacements for fossil based energy. This could be harnessed by setting up voluntary carbon markets that producers could join at their discretion. However, such a scheme could have unintended consequences. We conduct theoretical and empirical analyses of a voluntary ``carbon'' market examining both intended and unintended effects. We find certain participation rules can stimulate rebound effects from emitters and suppress participation from sequestration and bioenergy producing entities. To overcome this we develop and simulate offset participation limitations that could preclude unintended consequences.},

In contrast, studies on traits associated with species loss are fewer, and much remains unknown about how traits that predispose species to extinction affect ecological processes. Species gains and losses are both consequences and drivers of global change; thus, explicit integration of research on how both processes simultaneously affect ecosystem functioning is key to determining the response of the Earth system to current and future human activities.},

  abstract = {Methane (CH4) emissions from rice fields were determined using automated measurement systems in China, India, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines. Mitigation options were assessed separately for different baseline practices of irrigated rice, rainfed, and deepwater rice. Irrigated rice is the largest source of CH4 and also offers the most options to modify crop management for reducing these emissions. Optimizing irrigation patterns by additional drainage periods in the field or an early timing of midseason drainage accounted for 7-80\% of CH4 emissions of the respective baseline practice. In baseline practices with high organic amendments, use of compost (5863\%), biogas residues (10-16\%), and direct wet seeding (16-22\%) should be considered mitigation options. In baseline practices using prilled urea as sole N source, use of ammonium sulfate could reduce CH4 emission by 1067\%. In all rice ecosystems, CH4 emissions can be reduced by fallow incorporation (11\%) and mulching (11\%) of rice straw as well as addition of phosphogypsum (9-73\%). However, in rainfed and deepwater rice, mitigation options are very limited in both number and potential gains. The assessment of these crop management options includes their total factor productivity and possible adverse effects. Due to higher nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, changes in water regime are only recommended for rice systems with high baseline emissions of CH4. Key objectives of future research are identifying and characterizing high-emitting rice systems, developing site-specific technology packages, ascertaining synergies with productivity, and accounting for N2O emissions.},

  abstract = {Rice is the principle staple crop of Asia and any deterioration of rice production systems through climate change would seriously impair food security in this continent. This review assesses spatial and temporal vulnerabilities of different rice production systems to climate change impacts in Asia. Initially, the review discusses the risks of increasing heat stress and maps the regions where current temperatures are already approaching critical levels during the susceptible stages of the rice plant, namely Pakistan/north India (Oct.), south India (April, Aug.), east India/Bangladesh (March-June), Myanmar/Thailand/Laos/Cambodia (March-June), Vietnam (April/Aug.), Philippines (April/June), Indonesia (Aug.) and China (July/Aug.). Possible adaptation options for heat stress are derived from regions where the rice crop is already exposed to very high temperatures including Iran and Australia. Drought stress is also expected to aggravate through climate change; a map superimposing the distribution of rainfed rice and precipitation anomalies in Asia highlights especially vulnerable areas in east India/Bangladesh and Myanmar/Thailand. Then, the review gives emphasis to two rice growing environments that have outstanding importance for food supply in Asia and, at the same time, are particularly vulnerable to climate impacts. The mega-deltas in Vietnam, Myanmar and Bangladesh are the backbone of the rice economy in the respective country and will experience specific climate change impacts due to sea level rise. Significant improvements of the rice production systems, that is, higher resilience to flooding and salinity, are crucial for maintaining or even increasing yield levels in these very productive deltaic regions. The other `hotspot' with especially high climate change risks in Asia is the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) which will be affected by the melting of the Himalayan glaciers. The dominant land use type in the IGP is rice-wheat rotation, and we discuss specific vulnerabilities and possible adaptation options in the different sub-regions of the IGP. We conclude that geo-spatial vulnerability assessments may become crucial for planning targeted adaptation programs, but that policy frameworks are needed for their implementation.},

  abstract = {This review addresses possible adaptation strategies in rice production to abiotic stresses that will aggravate under climate change: heat (high temperature and humidity), drought, salinity, and submergence. Each stress is discussed regarding the current state of knowledge on damage mechanism for rice plants as well as possible developments in germplasm and crop management technologies to overcome production losses. Higher temperatures can adversely affect rice yields through two principal pathways, namely (i) high maximum temperatures that cause-in combination with high humidity-spikelet sterility and adversely affect grain quality and (ii) increased nighttime temperatures that may reduce assimilate accumulation. On the other hand, some rice cultivars are grown in extremely hot environments, so that the development of rice germplasm with improved heat resistance can capture an enormous genetic pool for this trait. Likewise, drought is a common phenomenon in many rice growing environments, and agriculture research has achieved considerable progress in terms of germplasm improvement and crop management (i.e., water saving techniques) to cope with the complexity of the drought syndrome. Rice is highly sensitive to salinity. Salinity often coincides with other stresses in rice production, namely drought in inland areas or submergence in coastal areas. Submergence tolerance of rice plants has substantially been improved by introgressing the Sub1 gene into popular rice cultivars in many Asian rice growing areas. Finally, the review comprises a comparative assessment of the rice versus other crops related to climate change. The rice crop has many unique features in terms of susceptibility and adaptation to climate change impacts due to its semiaquatic phylogenetic origin. The bulk of global rice supply originates from irrigated systems which are to some extent shielded from immediate drought effects. The buffer effect of irrigation against climate change impacts, however, will depend on nature and state of the respective irrigation system. The envisaged propagation of irrigation water saving techniques will entail benefits for the resilience of rice production systems to future droughts. We conclude that there are considerable risks for rice production stemming from climate change, but that the development of necessary adaptation options can capitalize on an enormous variety of rice production systems in very different climates and on encouraging progress in recent research. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Recent introduction of modern drainage systems has produced intensely dry conditions in rice farmlands and has degraded habitats for aquatic animals. In this study, we compared water beetle (Coleoptera) and water bug (Heteroptera) communities within rice fields cultivated under different management regimes: V-furrow no-till direct-seeding (DS) and conventional regimes. In DS fields, rice is sown in well-drained fields, and flooding is performed a month later than in conventional rice fields. DS fields are then continuously flooded until harvesting; unlike in conventional fields, where midseason drainage is performed in summer. We observed that DS fields supported higher densities of water beetles and water bugs than conventional fields, probably because of the high compatibility between the flooding period and the reproductive season of the insects. The species richness of water beetles was higher in DS fields than in conventional fields. Overall, DS fields showed higher water beetle and water bug abundance, but the effect was variable for individual species: seven species were more abundant in DS than in conventional fields, whereas two species showed opposite tendencies. Considering the differential responses among species to the management regimes, a mosaic of DS and conventional fields is preferable to either field alone for the conservation of aquatic insects in rice agroecosystems. {\copyright} 2013 Entomological Society of America.},

  abstract = {1. Temporary aquatic habitats often are inhabited by a unique fauna and flora and contribute significantly to regional diversity. Temporary wetlands around the world are disappearing rapidly. The individual and interacting impacts of factors influencing community structure and dynamics in temporary wetlands are not always well known. 2. Camargue wetlands are mainly characterized by variable salinity and hydroperiod. The individual and combined impacts of these local factors, together with regional variables, on invertebrate communities remain unknown. We therefore characterized and sampled invertebrates in 30 temporary wetlands along salinity and hydroperiod gradients in the Camargue (Southern France) 3, 5 and 7 months after inundation. 3. Over the three sampling occasions, a total of 17 cladoceran species and 49 macroinvertebrate taxa were identified. Hydroperiod and salinity were the most important variables explaining variation in taxonomic composition and can be considered key factors shaping the invertebrate communities in Camargue wetlands. The impact on taxon richness was significantly positive for hydroperiod but significantly negative for salinity. Regional factors had no significant effect on the structure of the studied invertebrate communities, suggesting that dispersal was not limiting and that species sorting was the most important structuring process. 4. The results of this study suggest that the combined and interacting effects of salinization and hydrological modification of Mediterranean temporary wetlands (due to water management, climate change, etc.) can result in reduced diversity in large numbers of Mediterranean wetlands and induce a considerable decline in regional diversity of aquatic invertebrates.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  abstract = {Organic carbon (OC) sequestration in degraded semi-arid environments by improved soil management is assumed to contribute substantially to climate change mitigation. However, information about the soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration potential in steppe soils and their current saturation status remains unknown. In this study, we estimated the OC storage capacity of semi-arid grassland soils on the basis of remote, natural steppe fragments in northern China. Based on the maximum OC saturation of silt and clay particles {$<$}20 lm, OC sequestration potentials of degraded steppe soils (grazing land, arable land, eroded areas) were estimated. The analysis of natural grassland soils revealed a strong linear regression between the proportion of the fine fraction and its OC content, confirming the importance of silt and clay particles for OC stabilization in steppe soils. This relationship was similar to derived regressions in temperate and tropical soils but on a lower level, probably due to a lower C input and different clay mineralogy. In relation to the estimated OC storage capacity, degraded steppe soils showed a high OC saturation of 78--85\% despite massive SOC losses due to unsustainable land use. As a result, the potential of degraded grassland soils to sequester additional OC was generally low. This can be related to a relatively high contribution of labile SOC, which is preferentially lost in the course of soil degradation. Moreover, wind erosion leads to substantial loss of silt and clay particles and consequently results in a direct loss of the ability to stabilize additional OC. Our findings indicate that the SOC loss in semi-arid environments induced by intensive land use is largely irreversible. Observed SOC increases after improved land management mainly result in an accumulation of labile SOC prone to land use/climate changes and therefore cannot be regarded as contribution to long-term OC sequestration.},

  abstract = {Coarse woody debris (CWD) plays an important role in many terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem processes. In recent years, a number of new methods have been proposed to sample CWD. Of these methods, perpendicular distance sampling (PDS) is one of the most efficient methods for estimating CWD volume in terms of both estimator variance and field effort. This study extends the results for PDS to the estimation of the surface area of CWD. The PDS estimator is also compared to two line intersect sampling (LIS) estimators, where one of the LIS estimators requires the measurement of surface area on each log and the other estimates surface area using a single measurement of log circumference at the point of intersection between the log and the line. The first estimator approximates the true surface area by assuming either a conic or parabolic stem form and requires measurements of the end diameters of each log, which is more time consuming than a single measurement. The performance of the three estimators was compared using a computer simulation. The results of the simulation indicate that, given the same number of pieces of CWD sampled at each point, equal variances can be achieved with PDS using sample sizes that range from about 10\% to in excess of 100\% the size of a comparable LIS estimator. When the LIS estimators were compared, the estimator that required the measurement of surface area was only about 3\%--6\% more efficient than the alternative estimator, but the bias associated with assuming a conic or parabolic stem form ranged from roughly 5\% to 15\%. We conclude that PDS will generally outperform either of the LIS estimators. Another important conclusion is that the LIS estimator based on a measured surface area is likely to have a higher mean squared error than an LIS estimator that employs a single measurement of circumference. Thus, LIS sampling strategies that require the least amount of field work will often have the smallest mean square error.},

However, few Australian studies have been undertaken which specifically address the effects of commercial management regimes on rice field biodiversity. In this study, we compared aquatic macroinvertebrate communities within Australian rice fields cultivated under three commercial management regimes: conventional-aerial (agrochemicals applied, aerially sown), conventional-drill (agrochemicals applied, directly drill-sown) and organic-drill (agrochemical-free, directly drill-sown). These comparisons were undertaken using a combination of community assessment approaches, including morphospecies richness, abundance, diversity and community composition. In general, greater biodiversity existed within macroinvertebrate communities that developed under organic management regimes than under conventional regimes (i.e., higher morphospecies richness and Shannon diversity). Although there were significant differences in several parameters across management regimes early in the rice-growing season, as the growing season progressed the invertebrate communities that developed in the different management regimes became more similar. Only community composition analyses showed significant differences late in the growing season, with functional differences across aquatic faunal assemblages suggested by increased predator abundance in communities sampled from the organic management regime. In order to improve biodiversity within these aquatic environments, management techniques need to be examined individually and the most disruptive processes identified. Alternative management procedures can then be developed that minimise biodiversity loss whilst still delivering required agronomic outcomes.},

The objectives of this study were a) to assess the effect of different types of manure amendments and rice varieties on greenhouse gas emissions and b) to determine the optimum manure application rate to increase rice yield while mitigating GHG emissions under alternate wetting and drying irrigation in paddy rice production. The first pot experiment was conducted at the Department of Agronomy, Yezin Agricultural University, Myanmar, in the wet season from June to October 2016. Two different organic manures (compost and cow dung) and control (no manure), and two rice varieties; Manawthukha (135 days) and IR-50 (115 days), were tested. The results showed that cumulative CH               4               emission from Manawthukha (1.084 g CH               4               kg               -1               soil) was significantly higher than that from IR-50 (0.683 g CH               4               kg               -1               soil) (P{$<$}0.0046) with yield increase (P{$<$}0.0164) because of the longer growth duration of the former. In contrast, higher cumulative nitrous oxide emissions were found for IR-50 (2.644 mg N               2               O kg               -1               soil) than for Manawthukha (2.585 mg N               2               O kg               -1               soil). However, IR-50 showed less global warming potential (GWP) than Manawthukha (P{$<$}0.0050). Although not significant, the numerically lowest CH               4               and N               2               O emissions were observed in the cow dung manure treatment (0.808 g CH               4               kg               -1               soil, 2.135 mg N               2               O kg               -1               soil) compared to those of the control and compost. To determine the effect of water management and organic manures on greenhouse gas emissions, second pot experiments were conducted in Madaya township during the dry and wet seasons from February to October 2017. Two water management practices \{continuous flooding (CF) and alternate wetting and drying (AWD)\} and four cow dung manure rates \{(1) 0 (2) 2.5 t ha               -1               (3) 5 t ha               -1               (4) 7.5 t ha               -1               \} were tested. The different cow dung manure rates did not significantly affect grain yield or greenhouse gas emissions in this experiment. Across the manure treatments, AWD irrigation significantly reduced CH               4               emissions by 70\% during the dry season and 66\% during the wet season. Although a relative increase in N               2               O emissions under AWD was observed in both rice seasons, the global warming potential was significantly reduced in AWD compared to CF in both seasons (P{$<$}0.0002, P{$<$}0.0000) according to reduced emission in CH               4               . Therefore, AWD is the effective mitigation practice for reducing GWP without compromising rice yield while manure amendment had no significant effect on GHG emission from paddy rice field. Besides, AWD saved water about 10\% in dry season and 19\% in wet season.},

The experiment was carried out in a natural wetland area, and in two flooded rice areas managed under organic and conventional systems. Twenty-five decomposition bags filled with 10g of dry vegetation were installed in each site. At 14, 28, 42, 56, and 7d0ays after the beginning of the experiment, five bags from each site were collected. Macroinvertebrates were identified and classified by functional trophic group. The number of species of benthic macroinvertebrates increased: natural wetland {$>$} organic system {$>$} conventional system. The Chironomidae group was present in all areas, confirming its food plasticity and adaptability to different substrates and environmental stress situations. The Amphipoda group was present only in the artificially flooded rice area, and the Acari, only in the natural wetland. The diversity of species in the natural wetland area was higher than in the artificially flooded rice area. Nutrient cycling, provided by phytomass decomposition, is affected by the management system, and the delay in this process causes a reduction of the ecosystem functions in the conventional system.},

It includes whole fallen trees and branches, pieces of fragmented wood, stumps, and standing dead trees (snags). A number of sampling approaches have been used to quantify CWD but there has been little systematic analysis of alternative approaches in terms of sampling efficiency. This study analysed sampling methods for CWD in three Australian forest types: eucalypt-dominated woodlands in south central Queensland, eucalypt open forest (dry sclerophyll forest) in south coastal New South Wales and eucalypt tall open forest in southern Tasmania. All downed wood (greater than 10 cm in woodland and 15 cm in other forest types) was measured and mapped on several large plots (1 ha) at each site. Alternative sampling approaches were compared using a computer-based system. These included varying length and arrangement of lines for the line intersect method and varying sizes of fixed-area plots.},

  abstract = {Background: Coarse and fine woody debris are substantial forest ecosystem carbon stocks; however, there is a lack of understanding how these detrital carbon stocks vary across forested landscapes. Because forest woody detritus production and decay rates may partially depend on climatic conditions, the accumulation of coarse and fine woody debris carbon stocks in forests may be correlated with climate. This study used a nationwide inventory of coarse and fine woody debris in the United States to examine how these carbon stocks vary by climatic regions and variables. Results: Mean coarse and fine woody debris forest carbon stocks vary by K{\"o}ppen's climatic regions across the United States. The highest carbon stocks were found in regions with cool summers while the lowest carbon stocks were found in arid desert/steppes or temperate humid regions. Coarse and fine woody debris carbon stocks were found to be positively correlated with available moisture and negatively correlated with maximum temperature. Conclusion: It was concluded with only medium confidence that coarse and fine woody debris carbon stocks may be at risk of becoming net emitter of carbon under a global climate warming scenario as increases in coarse or fine woody debris production (sinks) may be more than offset by increases in forest woody detritus decay rates (emission). Given the preliminary results of this study and the rather tenuous status of coarse and fine woody debris carbon stocks as either a source or sink of CO2, further research is suggested in the areas of forest detritus decay and production. {\copyright} 2008 Woodall and Liknes; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Currently, information regarding the prevalence, status, and methods of DW inventories occurring in the world's forested landscapes is scattered. The goal of this study is to describe the status, DW components measured, sample methods employed, and DW component thresholds used by national forest inventories that currently inventory DW around the world. Study results indicate that most countries do not inventory forest DW. Globally, we estimate that about 13\% of countries inventory DW using a diversity of sample methods and DW component definitions. A common feature among DW inventories was that most countries had only just begun DW inventories and employ very low sample intensities. There are major hurdles to harmonizing national forest inventories of DW: differences in population definitions, lack of clarity on sample protocols/estimation procedures, and sparse availability of inventory data/reports. Increasing database/estimation flexibility, developing common dimensional thresholds of DW components, publishing inventory procedures/protocols, releasing inventory data/reports to international peer review, and increasing communication (e.g., workshops) among countries inventorying DW are suggestions forwarded by this study to increase DW inventory harmonization. {\copyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Using the national DWM inventory, attributes (e.g., carbon stock totals and biomass density) were summarized by state and common tree species along with evaluations of residue pile metrics and relationships between DWM and other stand attributes (e.g., live tree biomass, relative density, and climate). Results indicate that DWM are ubiquitous in US forests with individual components (e.g., fine woody debris and piles) varying by region as influenced by endemic ecosystem dynamics and management practices. Eastern forests, particularly in the southeast, have fine woody debris and residue piles biomass densities that often exceed those of west coast forests. Rocky Mountain forests have coarse woody biomass densities approaching those of west coast forests, which have the largest amounts nationally. There is a complex relationship between the standing dead, standing live, and down dead wood biomass densities per unit area in the context of changing stand relative densities and average annual precipitation/minimum temperatures. As evidenced by this initial exploration, a publicly available national dataset comprised of DWM attributes may inform decision makers with objective estimates of DWM resources and facilitate further DWM dynamics research. {\copyright} 2013.},

To understand this for paddy soil, an incubation experiment (25 {\textopenbullet}C, 45\% water-holding capacity) was established using 14C-labelled glucose and rice straw (500 {\textmu}g C g-1 soil) as substrates; an adjacent upland soil was used for comparison. RESULTS: The amount of microbial biomass in the paddy soil was approximately 6 times larger and its turnover rate was 1.5--3 times faster than in the upland soil. These proportions of 14C-labelled glucose and rice straw mineralized in the paddy soil were about 3\% smaller (P {$<$} 0.01) than those in the upland soil. Also, there was no significant priming effect of fresh substrate additions on the mineralization of native organic C in the paddy soil, while the priming effect was significant in the upland soil. CONCLUSION: Although the paddy soil contains a large amount of microbial biomass, which is also very active, the mineralization of fresh substrates is significantly restricted in this soil, along with a small priming effect. This favours the accumulation of organic C in paddy soils.},

We conducted a half-year straw decomposition assay in a 16-year experiment with tillage (conventional tillage or no-tillage) and fertilization (single or combined nitrogen, phosphorus and/or cow manure addition) regimes in a dryland agroecosystem. Straw decomposition and extracellular enzyme activities as well as bacterial, fungal, protistan and metazoan communities in the straw residues were analyzed. Straw mass loss was accelerated by tillage, whereas it was slowered by all but not single nitrogen fertilization treatments and correlated negatively with soil fertility. Enzyme activities were sensitive to tillage and fertilization but not correlated with straw decomposition. Straw mass loss was positively correlated with the relative abundances of a dominant saprotrophic fungus (related to Apodus deciduus) and an ecological cluster of the inter-kingdom co-occurrence network, whose abundances were increased by tillage and decreased with increasing soil fertility. This study shows strong effects of agricultural practices on straw decomposition, and highlights the importance of key decomposers and inter-kingdom interactions in regulating straw decomposition. We propose that straw incorporation should be applied with appropriate tillage and reduced fertilizers in dryland agroecosystems.},

Hypothesized mechanisms for this involve: (1) release of cellular materials as a result of the rapid increase in water potential stress and (2) stimulating C-supply to microbes via physical processes. The balance of these factors is still not well understood, particularly in the contexts of multiple dry/wet cycles and of how resource and stress patterns vary through the soil profile. We evaluated the effects of multiple dry/wet cycles on surface and subsurface soils from a California annual grassland. Treatments included 4, 6, and 12 cycles that varied the length of the drying period between rewetting events. Respiration was monitored after each wetting event while extractable C and N, microbial biomass, and microbial activity were assayed initially, after the first rewetting event, and at the end of the experiment. Initially, microbial biomass and activity (respiration, dehydrogenase, and N mineralization) in subsurface soils were ca. 10\% and 20\% of surface soil levels. After multiple cycles, however, subsurface soil microbial biomass and activity were enhanced by up to 8-fold, even in comparison to the constantly moist treatment. By comparison, surface soil microbial biomass and activity were either moderately (i.e. 1.5 times increase) or not affected by wetting and drying. Drying and rewetting led to a cascade of responses (soluble C release, biomass growth, and enhanced activity) that mobilized and metabolized otherwise unavailable soil carbon, particularly in subsurface soils. {\copyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, in the literature, only a few reports are available on the effects of soil moisture regime and straw application in the non-rice-growing season separately on CH4 emissions during the rice-growing season. The objective of this study was to investigate CH4 emissions during the winter fallow and the following rice-growing season as affected by soil moisture regime and rice straw application during the fallow season. The experiment was designed to have 10 treatments, that is, five soil water contents (18\%, 38\%, 59\%, and 79\% of soil water-holding capacity [SWHC] and flooding; hereafter, W18, W38, W59, W79, and W100) and two rice straw application rates (0.91 and 4.55 g kg-1 dry soil; hereafter, Sl and Sh) during the fallow season. Both W100 and W79 showed obvious CH4 emissions during the fallow season, contributing 5.3\% and 5.9\% (Sl) and 34.8\% and 27.8\% (Sh), respectively, to their gross CH4 emissions, which increased significantly with the rising soil water content in the fallow season, except for W18. Rice straw application significantly affected gross CH4 emissions, but its effect was strongly influenced by soil moisture. The CH4 emissions per unit weight of rice straw applied of W38 and W59 were 9\% and 16\%, respectively, as much as that of W100. The findings demonstrate that keeping the soil water content in the range of 38-59\% SWHC in the fallow season is important for a reduction in CH4 emissions. {\copyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Three water regimes during the growing season of a drought resistant rice cultivar (Oryza sativa L. subsp. indica), including continuous flooding (CF), flooded and wet intermittent irrigation (FWI), and rain-fed with limited irrigation for fertilizer application and in the case of serious drought (RFL), were initiated in 2012 in Hubei province, China. Emissions of GHGs were monitored from sowing of rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) to rice harvest in 2014, and the GWP and yield-scaled GWP were estimated from an annual rapeseed-rice rotation. Compared with CF, over the two rice seasons, FWI and RFL treatments significantly reduced methane (CH4) emissions, while apparently increased nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. FWI and RFL treatments practiced in rice season did not trigger significant CO2 emissions in the following rapeseed season. However, N2O emissions in the rapeseed season were significantly reduced by FWI and RFL treatments, thus there were no significantly difference in annual N2O emissions among three treatments. Although the rapeseed season showed a weak source of CH4 emission, the plots preceded by water-saving treatments continuously presented a reduction tendency in CH4 emissions in rapeseed season. Totally, in comparison to CF treatment, the averaged annual GWP over the whole rotation cycle were significantly decreased by 21\% and 24\% under FWI and the RFL treatments, respectively. Water-saving irrigation treatments obtained lower annual yield-scaled GWP than CF treatment. Compared with CF treatment, FWI treatment did not exhibit a yield loss in rice or rapeseed across both years. In conclusion, from a sustainable agricultural perspective, using water-saving irrigation like FWI treatment could be an effective and safe option for simultaneously realizing the three goals of saving water, mitigating GHGs and maintaining sustainable rapeseed-rice production.},

Incorporation of residues before planting of the next crop generally decreases yields due to N immobilization. Since a window of about 40 d is available between rice harvest and wheat planting, the effect of time of incorporation on rice residue decomposition and N mineralization--immobilization was studied in 1992--1993. The mass loss of residue was 25\% for a 10-d, 35\% for a 20-d, and 51\% for a 40-d decomposition period before wheat planting. Nitrogen release from residue ranged from 6 to 9 kg ha               -1               during the wheat season. The immobilization of urea N decreased when residue was allowed to decompose for 10-d or longer. Based on these studies, a long-term (1993--2000) experiment was conducted on a sandy loam soil to examine the effect of time of residue incorporation before sowing wheat when compared with burning or removal of residue on yields, N-use efficiency, and soil fertility. The effect of wheat residue incorporation with green manure (GM,               Sesbania cannabina               L.) on subsequent rice yields was also determined. Residue incorporation for 10 to 40 d had no effect on wheat yields. Rice yields increased (0.18--0.39 Mg ha               -1               ) when wheat residue was incorporated with GM. Starter N applied at residue incorporation did not influence wheat yields but decreased N recovery efficiency. Physiological efficiency was higher when rice straw was incorporated in wheat and when wheat straw plus GM were incorporated in rice than when rice straw was incorporated for 10 d or when the straw was burned. The long-term application of rice residue increased C accumulation in soil.},

  abstract = {Studies focused on mitigating CH4 emission from rice paddy fields are summarized and the possibilities and limits that the options might be applied to world's rice cultivation are discussed. The mitigation options are water management, soil amendments, organic matter management, different tillage, rotation, and cultivar selection. Altering water management, in particular promoting midseason aeration by short-term drainage, is one of the most promising strategies, although these practices may be limited to the rice paddy fields where the irrigation system is well prepared. Improving organic matter management by promoting aerobic degradation through composting or incorporating into soil during off-season drained period is another most promising candidate. There are several formidable obstacles to adopt the mitigation options into local rice farming, including limited applicability to different types of rice fields, increasing cost and labor, negative effects on rice yield and soil fertility, and time requirement for practical application. Further studies to verify the mitigation options should focus on the feasibility for local farmers. {\copyright} 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

  abstract = {Rice cultivation is an important anthropogenic source of atmospheric methane (CH4), the emission of which is affected by management practices. Many field measurements have been conducted in major rice-producing countries in Asia. We compiled a database of CH4 emissions from rice fields in Asia from peer-reviewed journals. We developed a statistical model to relate CH4 flux in the rice-growing season to soil properties, water regime in the rice-growing season, water status in the previous season, organic amendment and climate. The statistical results showed that all these variables significantly affected CH4 flux, and explained 68\% of the variability. Organic amendment and water regime in the rice-growing season were the top two controlling variables; climate was the least critical variable. The average CH4 fluxes from rice fields with single and multiple drainages were 60\% and 52\% of that from continuously flooded rice fields. The flux from fields that were flooded in the previous season was 2.8 times that from fields previously drained for a long season and 1.9 times that from fields previously drained for a short season. In contrast to the previously reported optimum soil pH of around neutrality, soils with pH of 5.0--5.5 gave the maximum CH4 emission. The model results demonstrate that application of rice straw at 6 t ha 1 before rice transplanting can increase CH4 emission by 2.1 times; when applied in the previous season, however, it increases CH4 emission by only 0.8 times. Default emission factors and scaling factors for different water regimes and organic amendments derived from this work can be used to develop national or regional emission inventories.},

Logs decomposed faster than snags. Among the sites examined, temperature and precipitation did not correlate with decomposition rates, which is consistent with other studies in the boreal region. Globally, a positive correlation between decomposition and mean annual temperatures was found, with decay-resistant trees less responsive than those with low decay resistance.},

  abstract = {Although most organic matter (OM) in soil is mineralized by microorganisms, the nonmicrobial processes, e.g., Fenton reactions and photo-degradation, strongly contribute to OM decomposition and CO2 emission and are frequently the chemical background of biotic transformations. Fenton oxidation is a catalytic reaction chain of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) with ferrous iron (Fe(II)) and Fe (oxyhydr)oxides that generates highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (HO{$\bullet$}) oxidizing OM to CO2. Globally, reactive Fe (oxyhydr)oxides store at least one quarter ({\textasciitilde}600 Gt) of organic C in soil, which may be subjected to Fenton reactions, in which nano-sized Fe (oxyhydr) oxides act as nanocatalysts. The Fenton mechanisms depend on the sources and pathways of reactive oxygen species (ROS): O{$\bullet$}2 , H2O2 and HO{$\bullet$}. Given that microorganisms continuously produce ROS, biotic Fenton chemistry is ubiquitous in all soils (including subsoil), especially in those with strong UV radiation, fluctuating O2 concentrations and redox conditions, microbial hotspots such as rhizosphere and detritusphere, and high contents of amorphous or short-range ordered Fe (oxyhydr)oxides. Charcoal and biochar mediate heterogeneous catalysis and ROS formation in soil directly -- as an electron shuttle -- or indirectly by electron transfer from the valence band to the conduction band in the minerals under UV irradiation. Despite the extremely short lifetime (from nanoseconds to a few days), ROS are continuously produced and sustain the ubiquity of chelators and Fe (III) reduction. For the first time, we calculated the fundamental Eh-pH diagrams for ROS species and showed their relevance for Fenton reactions under specific soil conditions. Based on its extremely high reactivity (Eo = 2.8 V), HO{$\bullet$} is one of the most powerful oxidants and may provide the most efficient energy release from Fenton reactions in soil. Even though the direct contribution of Fenton reactions to OM oxidation and CO2 emission is less than 0.5\% on the global level, in some soils and ecosystems (e.g., hot deserts, red soils in the tropics and wet subtropics) it can reach 30\% and even exceed 50\% of total CO2 emissions. Fenton reactions are omnipresent and play a dual role for soil C cycling: they stimulate OM mineralization (including the most stable C pools such as charred C) and facilitate long-term C stabilization due to the increased recalcitrance of remaining OM and organo-mineral complex formation. Agricultural management positively affects Fenton reactions, accelerating C cycling and nutrient acquisition by plants. Accordingly, Fenton reactions and their effects on OM decomposition and formation are an emerging research field that explains the chemical background of many oxidative enzymatic processes. This may crucially change our views on C, energy and nutrient cycling in soils, especially in a changing world.},

Recent empirically based models using individual species' traits suggest that higher species richness is required to provide multiple ecosystem functions. However, no study to date has analyzed the observed functionality of communities of interacting species over multiple temporal scales to assess the relationship between biodiversity and multifunctionality. We use data from the longest-running biodiversity-functioning field experiment to date to test how species diversity affects the ability of grassland ecosystems to provide threshold levels of up to eight ecosystem functions simultaneously. Across years and every combination of ecosystem functions, minimum-required species richness consistently increases with the number of functions considered. Moreover, tradeoffs between functions and variability among years prevent any one community type from providing high levels of multiple functions, regardless of its diversity. Sustained multifunctionality, therefore, likely requires both higher species richness than single ecosystem functionality and a diversity of species assemblages across the landscape.},

  abstract = {Acetylation is one of the most common types of wood modification and is commercially available throughout the world. Many studies have shown that acetylated wood is decay resistant at high levels of acetylation. Despite its widespread use, the mechanism by which acetylation prevents decay is still not fully understood. It is well known that at a given water activity, acetylation reduces the equilibrium moisture content of the wood cell wall. Furthermore, linear relationships have been found between the acetylation weight percent gain (WPG), wood moisture content, and the amount of mass loss in decay tests. This paper examines the relationships between wood moisture content and fungal growth in wood, with various levels of acetylation, by modifying the soil moisture content of standard soil block tests. The goal of the research is to determine if the reduction in fungal decay of acetylated wood is solely due to the reduction in moisture content or if there are additional antifungal effects of this chemical treatment. While a linear trend was observed between moisture content and mass loss caused by decay, it was not possible to separate out the effect of acetylation from fungal moisture generation. The data show significant deviations from previously proposed models for fungal moisture generation and suggest that these models cannot account for active moisture transport by the fungus. The study helps to advance our understanding of the role of moisture in the brown rot decay of modified wood.},

These rates, together with estimations of the amount of deadwood, can be used to calculate the release of carbon from that pool into the atmosphere. The model can be used for predictions of decomposition rate constants in a wide range of forest areas (e.g. in process based ecological models, reporting of GHG-emissions), as only easily available predictor variables were used in the regression. Based on an intensive literature research a meta-analysis on influencing factors controlling the constant decay rate of coarse woody debris was set up. The included studies differed significantly in the survey methods as well as in the geographical origin. 39 studies were collected, 30 appeared in North America and nine in Europe. Based on these studies 291 observations of the remaining fraction of coarse woody debris were collected. To quantify the effects that influence the decomposition rates a nonlinear mixed effects model was constructed. Only physiologically interpretable variables were included. With this approach it was possible to determine influencing effects from mean temperature in July, annual rainfall (as quadratic term), diameter of woody material and grouping into hardwoods or conifers and mass- or density loss were significant variables. The mixed effects model also allowed an estimation of the species-specific effects on the decomposition process. These random effects are given for 42 tree species. The degrees of freedom were used efficiently. The model explains 79.6\% of the variance and is superior to a comparable multiple regression model. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Overall, indicators of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, as well as multidiversity and ecosystem multifunctionality, were higher in tree islands compared to conventionally managed oil palm. Larger tree islands led to larger gains in multidiversity through changes in vegetation structure. Furthermore, tree enrichment did not decrease landscape-scale oil palm yield. Our results demonstrate that enriching oil palm-dominated landscapes with tree islands is a promising ecological restoration strategy, yet should not replace the protection of remaining forests.},

It was found that drainage in the fallow season significantly affected the temporal variations of CH4 production and emission from permanently flooded rice fields. CH4 production and emission from permanently flooded rice fields (Treatment FF) mainly occurred during the rice season, where they were found to be much lower in the late fallow season. No CH4 flux was detected from drained fields (Treatment DF) in the fallow season. Compared with Treatment FF, Treatment DF was delayed not only its onset of CH4 production and emission, but also appearance of the highest peak of CH4 production during the rice season. A significant positive relationship was observed between CH4 production rates of paddy soil and corresponding CH4 fluxes (P {\textbackslash}textless0.01). CH4 production in rice roots was the highest in rate at the rice booting stage, but was obviously lower at the rice tillering, grain filling and ripening stages, and the highest value reached at the same time as the peak of CH4 production occurred in the paddy soil. Drainage in the fallow season significantly decreased CH4 production and emission from Treatment FF. Compared with Treatment FF, Treatment DF was about 42-61\% lower in mean CH4 production rate in the paddy soil during the rice season, and was reduced by approximately 56\% in mean CH4 production rate in rice roots. Accordingly, Treatment DF was 20.6-30.2 g CH4 m-2, 39-52\% lower than Treatment FF in total CH4 emission during the rice season, and 44-57\% lower in annual total CH4 emission. Rice yield in Treatment DF tended to be 4-7\% lower than that in Treatment FF. {\copyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

  abstract = {Rice is one of the major crops of southern China and Southeast Asia. Rice paddies are one of the largest agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) sources in this region because of the application of large quantities of nitrogen (N) fertilizers to the plants. In particular, the production of methane (CH4) is a concern. Investigating a reasonable amount of fertilizers to apply to plants is essential to maintaining high yields while reducing GHG emissions. In this study, three levels of fertilizer application [high (300kgN/ha), moderate (210kgN/ha), and low (150kgN/ha)] were designed to examine the effects of variation in N fertilizer application rate on carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from the paddy fields in Chongming Island, Shanghai, China. The high level (300kgN/ha) represented the typical practice adopted by the local farmers in the area. Maximum amounts of CH4 and N2O fluxes were observed upon high-level fertilizer application in the plots. Cumulative N2O emissions of 23.09, 40.10, and 71.08mgN2O/m2 were observed over the growing season in 2011 under the low-, moderate-, and high-level applications plots, respectively. The field data also indicated that soil temperatures at 5 and 10cm soil depths significantly affected soil respiration; the relationship between Rs and soil temperature in this study could be described by an exponential model. Our study showed that reducing the high rate of fertilizer application is a feasible way of attenuating the global-warming potential while maintaining the optimum yield for the studied paddy fields. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Alternate wetting and drying irrigation (AWD) is promulgated as a practice for reducing irrigation water usage in rice production; however, the implications of AWD on soil properties and crop growth remain unclear. Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis encompassing 3194 observations from 200 published studies to assess the systemic effects of AWD on the aforementioned indices with the explicit aim of identifying approaches for yield improvement in rice. The results showed that, compared with continuous flooding, AWD increased water use efficiency by 31\% but with an average yield penalty of 6\%. Optimal AWD was applied when water potential was maintained at pressures greater than 15 kPa with water depths less than 18.5 cm during rice growing season. Changes in total organic carbon (TOC), pH and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3 ) in soil had significant influence on yield. These analyses suggested that limiting the effect sizes of TOC to less than 0.0003, pH above 0.015 and NO3 between 0.02 and 0.30 during AWD could increase rice yield by up to 4\%. Yield improvements of 5 {\textasciitilde} 7\% were obtained when TOC and available potassium in background soil greater than 27.83 g kg 1 and 0.18 g kg 1, respectively, under water potential greater than 40 kPa (MWP). Nitrogen application in low rates and the addition of straw or biochar under MWP further amplified the beneficial effects of soil C and N, increasing yields by 2 {\textasciitilde} 3\%. Overall, biochemical edaphic factors were primarily responsible for driving rice yield responses to AWD. It can be suggested that combining management practices with AWD can reduce total water input requirement while concurrently increasing rice yield.},

A 2-year (2012-2013) field experiment was conducted at a typical paddy rice field in a rural suburb of Shanghai, China. N losses and GHG emissions from the paddy field with alternative fertilizer management practices were simultaneously measured. Four treatments were tested in the experiment: applications of only chemical synthetic fertilizer urea (CT), only organic manure (OT), a combination of the two types of fertilizers (MT) and a control (CK). Results from the field study indicated that CT produced the highest seasonal N loading rate (18.79 kg N/ha) and N2O emissions (1.81 kg N2O/ha) but with the lowest seasonal CH4 emissions (69.09 kg CH4/ha). With organic manure applied, MT and OT respectively reduced N loading by 21.86\% and 30.41\%, reduced N2O emissions by 28.34\% and 69.41\%, but increased CH4 emissions by 137\% and 310\% in comparison with CT. However, the net impact of CH4 and N2O emissions on global warming was enhanced when organic manure was applied. In addition, CT and MT produced the optimal rice yield during the experimental period, while OT treatment led to a yield reduction by 9.29\% compared with CT. In conclusion, the impacts of alternative fertilizer management practices on ecosystem services ought to be assessed specifically due to the great variations across rice yields, N loss and GHG emissions.},

  abstract = {Automated transparent chambers have gained increasing popularity in recent years to continuously measure net CO2 fluxes between low-statured canopies and the atmosphere. In this study, we carried out four field campaigns with chamber measurements in a variety of mountainous grasslands. A mathematic stationary point (or critical point, a point at which the derivative of a function is zero) in the CO2 mixing ratio time series was found in a substantial fraction of the measurements at all the sites, which had a significant influence on the performances of the regression algorithms. The stationary point was probably due to condensed water on the inner wall of the chamber dome, which reduced the solar radiation and resulted in a reversal of the CO2 mixing ratio time series in the chamber (so called Clouded-Glass Effect or CGE in this study). This effect may be the cause of the observed underestimation of daytime CO2 fluxes when using common linear and exponential regression models on continuous automated chamber observations. In order to avoid biased flux estimation of daytime CO2 fluxes, we introduced a linearly increasing term to the exponential function so as to compensate for the influence of the CGE, which gives acceptable model errors and improves the CO2 flux estimation by 5\% for temperate mountainous grasslands. We conclude that exponential regression models should be favoured over linear models and recommend to account for the effects of CGE by either excluding ambiguous observations from the flux computations where stationary points can be identified in the CO2 mixing ratio time series, or by adding a linearly increasing term to the exponential regression model.},

Here, we synthesize the responses of soil MAOC and POC to LUC, including land restoration and degradation, from 693 soil observations globally. We observed a large increase in soil MAOC and POC after restoration and a greater decline after degradation, but the magnitude and proportion of these two carbon fractions (fMAOC and fPOC) varied with LUC. POC, in comparison with MAOC, responded more sensitively to LUC, suggesting that POC was more vulnerable to environmental change. Using observed duration relationships, we found that the fraction of POC (fPOC) was higher at the early stage of restoration but lower at the late stage, projecting that soil carbon stability declined after short-term restoration but gradually increased after long-term restoration. Further analysis showed the context-dependent effects of LUC on carbon fractions: in arid or carbon-poor topsoil, restoration greatly increased soil carbon fractions and fPOC, while in humid or carbon-rich topsoil, degradation resulted in large decreases in POC and MAOC, especially POC. Overall, we highlight the importance of soil fractions, particularly POC, in predicting soil carbon stability and suggest that incorporating climate and initial carbon status in models of soil carbon dynamics helps to accurately predict future carbon sink potential.},

  abstract = {Midseason drainage (MSD) has been proven as an effective strategy for mitigating methane (CH4) emissions in paddy fields. However, its efficacy under milk vetch (Astragalus sinicus L., MV) incorporation, a paddy green manure widely cultivated in East Asian countries, remains uncertain. A three-year field trial was conducted, including five treatments: common level of chemical fertilizer with continuous flooding (CF-F), MV incorporation and reduced chemical fertilizer with continuous flooding (MVCF-F) or with 5 (MVCF-D5), 10 (MVCF-D10), and 15 (MVCF-D15) days of MSD. The results showed that the MVCF-F treatment enhanced rice productivity and soil fertility but promoted CH4 emissions relative to the CF-F treatment. However, compared with the MVCF-F treatment, the MVCF-D5, MVCF-D10, and MVCF-D15 treatments significantly decreased average CH4 emissions by 20\%, 31\%, and 35\%, respectively. Furthermore, the MVCF-D5 and MVCF-D10 treatments led to a significant reduction in CH4 production potentials (PPs) and an increase in CH4 oxidation potentials (OPs). Compared to the MVCF-F treatment, the two treatments significantly decreased mcrA gene copy numbers from 23.44 {\texttimes} 107 copies g--1 to 12.62 {\texttimes} 107 copies g--1 and 11.26 {\texttimes} 107 copies g--1, while increasing pmoA gene copy numbers from 11.32 {\texttimes} 106 copies g--1 to 18.94 {\texttimes} 106 copies g--1 and 20.56 {\texttimes} 106 copies g--1, respectively. The results from the partial least squares-path model revealed that the reduction in CH4 emissions under MSD was mainly due to a decrease in CH4 PPs rather than an increase in CH4 OPs. The mcrA copy numbers, negatively regulated by soil Eh, was essential in regulating CH4 PPs. These findings provide evidence that MSD with a rational duration, even under exogenous carbon input through MV incorporation, can still effectively mitigate CH4 emissions in paddy fields. Considering that MSD with 15 days sacrificed the yield-increasing benefits of MV incorporation, MSD with 10 days is advisable in the study area.},

  abstract = {Biological diversity of agriculture consists of several analytic levels and spatial management scales that are subject to complex interactions with global change. The complexity of interactions is related to the bidirectional impacts and influences of global land use and climate change in combination with social-environmental shifts (globalization of agricultural development; market integration; technological change; and regulation through global treaties, policies, and institutions). This article develops a conceptual framework of the complexity of interactions using four thematic nodes---biological diversity in agriculture; global change; management and scale; and social-environmental adaptation, vulnerability, and resilience. It argues for the increased relevance of this framework. Linking expanded scientific research and policy to this group of conceptual nodes yields insight into the impacts of global change on biological diversity in agriculture and into the design of conservation strategies, monitoring approaches, and sustainability policies. Future policy must anticipate interactions of biological diversity, agroecosystem complexity, and global change stemming from the acceleration and integration of region-scale land-use intensification and disintensification.},

  abstract = {A 3-year field experiment was conducted to simultaneously measure methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from rice paddies under various agricultural managements including water regime, crop residue incorporation, and synthetic fertilizer application. In contrast with continuous flooding, midseason drainage incurred a drop in CH4 fluxes while triggering substantial N2O emission. Moreover, N2O emissions after midseason drainage depended strongly on whether or not fields were waterlogged due to intermittent irrigation. Urea application tended to reduce CH4 emissions but significantly increased N2O emissions. Under a water regime of flooding-midseason drainage-reflooding-moist intermittent irrigation but without water logging (F-D-F-M), both wheat straw and rapeseed cake incorporation increased CH4 emissions by 252\%, and rapeseed cake increased N2O by 17\% while wheat straw reduced N2O by 19\% compared to controls. Seasonal average fluxes of CH4 ranged from 25.4 mg m-2 d-1 when no additional residue was applied under the water regime of flooding-midseason drainage-reflooding to 116.9 mg m-2 d-1 when wheat straw was applied at 2.25 t ha-1 under continuous irrigation flooding. Seasonal average fluxes of N2O varied between 0.03 mg N2O-N m-2 d-1 under continuous flooding and 5.23 mg N2O-N m-2 d-1 under the water regime of F-D-F-M. Both crop residue-induced CH4, ranging from 9 to 15\% of the incorporated residue C, and N2O, ranging from 0.01 to 1.78\% of the applied N, were dependent on water regime in rice paddies. Estimations of net global warming potentials (GWPs) indicate that water management by flooding with midseason drainage and frequent water logging without the use of organic amendments is an effective option for mitigating the combined climatic impacts from CH4 and N2O in paddy rice production.

If a random sample of their work (including scientific papers) produced before doing these courses were selected, half would probably contain violations of the underlying assumptions of the statistical techniques employed. 2. Some violations have little impact on the results or ecological conclusions; yet others increase type I or type II errors, potentially resulting in wrong ecological conclusions. Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake. 3. Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4. Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations. It is therefore essential for good quality management and policy based on statistical analyses.},
